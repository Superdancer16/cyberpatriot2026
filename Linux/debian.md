# 🐧 Debian security checklist — comprehensive manual handbook (Debian 12 / 13; Debian 11 legacy)

> [!TIP]
> **🧭 Jump to a stage:** [📘 Basics](#stage-1) · [🚀 First steps](#stage-2) · [🛡️ Priority checks](#stage-3) · [⚙️ Services](#stage-4) · [🧰 Advanced](#stage-5) · [✅ Final checks](#stage-6)
> **🔎 Check · 🛠️ Fix · ✅ Verify · ↩️ Undo · ⚠️ Caution** — commands are for manual, scenario-aware use.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Read the image README before changing accounts, services, authentication, or network access.** Preserve forensic evidence and a recovery path; do not apply every example automatically.


**One self-contained CyberPatriot-style checklist.** This file merges the former Debian checklist with applicable instructions from the Linux Mint handbook, Linux investigations, Linux service-hardening reference and terminal primer. Its instructions are **Debian-specific**: inspect your actual release, desktop, installed service units and README before acting. No scripts or automation are needed. Every code block is meant to be read and run **individually** on an authorized practice image, never on this GitHub repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Priority order:** Read README and competition instructions → preserve/answer forensics → record working administration and critical services → inspect → make the smallest permitted change → verify login, required services and scoring → record how to undo.
>
> **Release status (November 2026):** Debian 13 (**trixie**) is stable; Debian 12 (**bookworm**) is oldstable and receives Debian LTS security support through June 2028; Debian 11 (**bullseye**) standard LTS ended August 31, 2026. If a practice/competition image still runs 11, do not change the release to 12/13 as an unrequested "fix." See [Debian releases](https://www.debian.org/releases/) and [Debian 11 LTS EOL](https://www.debian.org/News/2026/20260831).

**Debian-specific reminders:** Not every install has sudo, UFW, `rsyslog`, `unattended-upgrades`, GNOME, SSH or AppArmor profiles. Debian 12/13 can use deb822 `.sources` APT files. The absence of a package or log file is not by itself an error. Debian's root account can remain unlocked when installation selected a root password. Use a known, working recovery channel before changing it.

### How to use this file

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Read each numbered section from start to finish; mark tasks complete only after checking them.
- **Typing (check)** commands inspect. **Typing (change, only if authorized)** commands modify.
- `alice`, `bob`, `exampleuser`, `example.service`, IP addresses and file paths labeled examples **must be replaced**, never pasted blindly.
- Use **Terminal** on Debian GNOME (Super → Terminal) or the appropriate console. When already logged in as root after `su -`, omit `sudo` from example commands.
- Shell commands displayed under `bash` belong in a terminal; file directives under `text` belong **in the appropriate file**, not the shell.
- For root, sudo, PAM, SSH, firewall and service edits: keep **working console/recovery access** and back up the exact file you will edit. Use unique backup filenames; do not overwrite yesterday's backup.

## How to navigate the new order

**Basics → First things → Commonly assessed security tasks → Services and persistence → Advanced reference → Final verification.** Original numbered procedure names are retained inside the new phases so existing anchors still identify the topic.

---


**Prioritization reflects recurring topics in public checklists, not published per-fix score values.** The competition README, required accounts/services and evidence-preservation rules take precedence. Inspect first; change only what is allowed; verify and record rollback.


> [!NOTE]
> **📚 Evidence guide for CyberPatriot XVI–XIX:** **Official** means documented by CyberPatriot; **Training** means found in public practice/training materials; **Community** means covered by published checklists or educational repositories; **Inferred** means normal vendor-supported security hardening that is **not known to have been scored**. The report is a topic inventory, **not a list of actual confidential competition vulnerabilities, scoring keys or guaranteed points**. In the additional procedures below, every suggested change requires a verified scenario reason, a saved original value and a check of required service availability. All PowerShell/Bash examples are **manual commands inside Markdown**, not automation scripts. The image README and current rules always take precedence.

> [!TIP]
> 📘 **Foundation:** Review the key terms and available tools before making changes.


### Understand Debian before hardening

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Know that Debian **13 trixie is stable**, Debian **12 bookworm receives LTS security support until June 2028** for eligible packages/architectures, and Debian 11 regular LTS ended August 2026. Never replace the installed release mid-round without explicit instructions.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Know **root/sudo, APT/dpkg, PAM, systemd, SSH, nftables/UFW, AppArmor, journald/rsyslog**.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Recognize a missing sudo or UFW package, GNOME desktop, or auth.log as *potentially normal* for a Debian installation.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Keep a working root or authorized sudo session before account, PAM, firewall or SSH changes.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
cat /etc/os-release
id
command -v sudo
systemctl status display-manager --no-pager
~~~

## Part 2 — First Things to Do

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🚀 **Start here:** Follow the image README, preserve forensics, and confirm administrative recovery.


Read README, secure your administrative recovery, answer forensics before removing anything, and take an authorized snapshot only if allowed.

### 0. Before you touch anything

#### 0.1 Read the README, record initial state and preserve recovery
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 0.1 Read the README, record initial state and preserve recovery**

See [Reading the README](../General/All/reading-the-readme.md). In VMware: **VM → Snapshot → Take Snapshot**.

#### 0.2 Open a terminal
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 0.2 Open a terminal**

GNOME: press the **Super (Windows) key**, type `terminal`, press Enter.

#### 0.3 Become an administrator: `sudo` or `su -`
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 0.3 Become an administrator: sudo or su -**

```bash
sudo -v
```
- **No error:** good, use `sudo` like on Mint.
- **"Sorry, user ... may not run sudo"**, **"user is not in the sudoers file"** or **"sudo: command not found":** use the **root password** from the README:
  ```bash
  su -               # note the dash! it asks for ROOT's password
  ```
  Your prompt changes to `root@...#`. Now run every command **without** `sudo`.

> [!WARNING]
> Use `su -` **with the dash**. Plain `su` keeps your normal PATH, so commands like `usermod` or `ufw` give "command not found".

Optional, to make life easier: give the README's admins working `sudo` (this is often scored too):
```bash
apt install sudo
usermod -aG sudo alice       # every README admin
```
They must **log out and back in** before `sudo` works for them.

---

#### 0.4 Verify installed release, desktop and essential tools
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 0.4 Verify installed release, desktop and essential tools**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
uname -r
id
whoami
command -v sudo
command -v apt
systemctl status display-manager --no-pager
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpret:** The codename (bookworm, trixie, bullseye) determines supported APT suites and software versions; `systemctl status display-manager` can legitimately fail on a headless Debian Server. The root password, sudo group and available console access vary by installation.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Inventory your image's actual authorized **administrators, users, required daemons, permitted ports, and banned applications**. Save hashes/screenshots and forensics answers in a private folder. Do not share extracted passwords or student data publicly. Use a VM snapshot only if permitted by the round rules.

**Recovery:** Keep the root/administrative session open and test a second authorized login before disabling or locking accounts.

---

### 1. Forensics questions (FIRST)

#### 1.1 Answer them before changing anything
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 1.1 Answer them before changing anything**

Debian forensics uses local commands; check whether logs exist before assuming a missing file means no activity.
```bash
sudo journalctl _COMM=sshd | tail -50         # SSH logins
sudo journalctl _COMM=sudo                    # every sudo command
sudo journalctl -u cron --since "2 days ago"  # cron jobs that ran
sudo journalctl --list-boots                  # boot history
last -a | head -20                            # recent logins
```
Without `sudo` (or root), `journalctl` shows only **your own** messages, so a login by someone else would be missing.

`/var/log/auth.log` only exists if `rsyslog` is installed (Debian 11 has it; Debian 12 doesn't until you install it in step 10.1, and then it only has new events).

#### 1.2 Manual audit (no hardening scripts)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 1.2 Manual audit (no hardening scripts)**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Prepare a manual baseline. The upstream automation is not included in this repository.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** A status label cannot establish that a setting is correct on this particular image.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Read the README and preserve forensics evidence. Record your current administrator account, required users, services, ports, and initial score.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** Open the README and Scoring Report from the desktop. In your VM manager, create a practice snapshot only if the round rules permit it. Open the platform's account and service management screens described below.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
**✅ Check it worked:** Repeat each inspection, test the README-required function, then refresh the Scoring Report. A lack of new points does not prove the change failed.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Reverse the most recent change using the recorded value or the procedure's backup. A VM snapshot rollback can discard later fixes; use it only within the rules and verify the resulting score again.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Never use a guessed list of authorized users or bulk-delete files. See [Using the scripts safely](../Misc%20Softwares/using-the-scripts.md) for the limits of external tools.

---

#### 1.3 Investigate questions without changing evidence
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 1.3 Investigate questions without changing evidence**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Open each forensic question file, copy the exact question and answer format, note required name/path/hash/encoding, and locate evidence **before cleaning or patching**.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
find "$HOME/Desktop" -maxdepth 2 -type f -iname '*forensic*' -print 2>/dev/null
find /home /root -type f -iname '*secret*' -print 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
file /path/to/evidence
stat /path/to/evidence
sha256sum /path/to/evidence
```

```bash
sudo journalctl -n 80 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u ssh --since "yesterday" --no-pager
last -a | head -30
```

When a known string is explicitly said to be Base64, decode **only the text** (never execute decoded content):

```bash
printf '%s' 'aGVsbG8=' | base64 --decode
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpretation:** A hash identifies exact file contents; creation/modified/access times have different meanings. `journalctl` may have only volatile logs unless persistent storage was configured. `/var/log/auth.log` often exists only when rsyslog is configured. Capture relevant artifacts in your permitted evidence folder and answer in the required file.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Avoid recursive wide searches over `/proc`/`/sys`, avoid opening suspicious executables, and never purge packages/delete users/clear logs before relevant questions are answered. If evidence is found, write down the finding and exact path before changing anything.

## Part 3 — Commonly Assessed High-Priority Checks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🛡️ **Priority checks:** Inspect the most common security categories first; actual scoring remains image-specific.


Review identities/sudo, password policy, firewall and updates before the longer service-specific material.

### 🎯 Debian 12 Training Round 2 — task-first skill cards (generalized)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These tasks correspond to concepts demonstrated in the supplied *CyberPatriot Debian 12 Training Round 2 Answer Key*. **The source's exact usernames, forensic answers and points are deliberately not republished.** This is a task/reference checklist, **not a list of universal fixes**. Debian's supported Terminal commands are usually the easiest method; alternative checks and contextual explanations appear only in colored boxes.

#### 🎯 DT01 — Decode a multi-layer forensic message

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Decode a multi-layer forensic message.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Read the supplied forensic text and identify each encoding; use an approved decoder to apply Base64, ROT13, reversal, or other requested transformations **one layer at a time**.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `printf '%s' 'aGVsbG8=' | base64 --decode`

**✅ VERIFY:** Save the decoded response in the exact format requested by the question.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Do not upload private evidence to an unapproved site or execute decoded output.

#### 🎯 DT02 — Locate media files named in a forensic question

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Locate media files named in a forensic question.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Open Terminal and use a focused filename search under the home directories; record the exact path requested, without deleting anything.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `find /home -type f -iname '*.mp3' -print 2>/dev/null`

**✅ VERIFY:** Verify the path belongs to the actual requested files and save the question answer.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** `locate` may use a stale database; `find` reflects existing files. Do not assume any MP3 is prohibited until checking README.

#### 🎯 DT03 — Identify and contain unauthorized human users

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Identify and contain unauthorized human users.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** List all accounts, compare the README against real human logins, and **lock only confirmed unauthorized accounts** after preserving evidence.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `getent passwd`

**✅ VERIFY:** Recheck the account's existence and lock status; ensure required service accounts remain untouched.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** A training key may delete a user directly; containment first is easier to undo, and `userdel -r` can destroy home data.

#### 🎯 DT04 — Remove a user’s unauthorized sudo privileges

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Remove a user’s unauthorized sudo privileges.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Inspect `sudo` membership and effective sudoers; remove the exact user only if the README lists them as a nonadministrator.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo gpasswd -d EXAMPLE_USER sudo`

**✅ VERIFY:** Check `id EXAMPLE_USER` and `getent group sudo`, then test a permitted administrator account.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Do not remove the only administrator or forget NOPASSWD policies in `/etc/sudoers.d`.

#### 🎯 DT05 — Set a weak authorized user's password

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Set a weak authorized user's password.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Use an authorized Terminal and run `sudo passwd EXAMPLE_USER`, entering the README-compliant password interactively.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo passwd -S EXAMPLE_USER`

**✅ VERIFY:** Confirm the password-change success and test a legitimate new login.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Never type real passwords in GitHub text or reset an unknown daemon's service account.

#### 🎯 DT06 — Add a required user to the correct group

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Add a required user to the correct group.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Verify the user and group both exist, then use `sudo adduser EXAMPLE_USER EXAMPLE_REQUIRED_GROUP` only when the README requires this membership.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo usermod -aG EXAMPLE_REQUIRED_GROUP EXAMPLE_USER`

**✅ VERIFY:** Verify the user appears in `getent group EXAMPLE_REQUIRED_GROUP` or `id EXAMPLE_USER`.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Creating a group or adding members unnecessarily may grant unwanted permissions; group names are image-specific.

#### 🎯 DT07 — Set the required default minimum password age

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Set the required default minimum password age.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Inspect `PASS_MIN_DAYS` in `/etc/login.defs`, back it up, and use `sudo nano /etc/login.defs` to apply the exact README value.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `grep -E '^PASS_MIN_DAYS' /etc/login.defs`

**✅ VERIFY:** Re-read the file and check individual existing users with `chage -l`.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Changes to login.defs are defaults and don't necessarily update existing accounts. Restore its previous value if wrong.

#### 🎯 DT08 — Require a password minimum length through the installed PAM module

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Require a password minimum length through the installed PAM module.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Check whether `libpam-pwquality` exists, back up `/etc/pam.d/common-password`, then edit the **existing** supported `pam_pwquality.so` configuration to match the actual requirement.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo grep -n 'pam_pwquality' /etc/pam.d/common-password`

**✅ VERIFY:** Test an authorized password change on a noncritical account and confirm the new minimum policy operates.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Never insert duplicate PAM lines or blindly copy module order; mistakes can lock out every account.

#### 🎯 DT09 — Configure and test a supported failed-login lockout policy

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Configure and test a supported failed-login lockout policy.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Preserve root/recovery access, inspect supported `pam_faillock` and `pam-auth-update` profiles, and configure **only** the required lockout using the installed Debian PAM mechanisms.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo grep -Rns 'pam_faillock' /etc/pam.d /usr/share/pam-configs 2>/dev/null`

**✅ VERIFY:** Test a normal new login and sudo before closing the admin console; inspect faillock output when available.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** A training example creates PAM profile snippets; their exact priorities/control flags are version-specific. Do not paste a partial PAM stack into another image.

#### 🎯 DT10 — Reject empty passwords in PAM where required

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Reject empty passwords in PAM where required.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Inspect `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` and the actual `pam_unix.so` authentication options; remove an unauthorized `nullok` **only after backing up that file**.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo grep -n 'pam_unix.so' /etc/pam.d/common-auth`

**✅ VERIFY:** Test a separate authorized login, sudo, and expected account functionality.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Edit using sudo; the presence of a module option is not automatically a problem without confirming the README and authentication path.

#### 🎯 DT11 — Verify IPv4 TCP SYN cookies are enabled when appropriate

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Verify IPv4 TCP SYN cookies are enabled when appropriate.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Check the effective sysctl value; if the image requires SYN cookies, edit its actual effective sysctl config to enable `net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1`.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies`

**✅ VERIFY:** Confirm effective value is `1` and required networking remains operational.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Prefer one narrowly scoped supported sysctl file, not a blind replacement of `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

#### 🎯 DT12 — Disable IPv4 forwarding only on a host that must not route

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Disable IPv4 forwarding only on a host that must not route.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Check `net.ipv4.ip_forward`, the host role, VPN/container configuration and README, then set it to `0` **only if routing is not required**.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward`

**✅ VERIFY:** Verify the effective value and test normal networking and approved remote access.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Changing forwarding on an actual router/VPN host can break required services and lose points.

#### 🎯 DT13 — Enable the required host firewall without blocking access

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Enable the required host firewall without blocking access.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Identify the active firewall manager, record required inbound ports, allow necessary SSH/web/DB services, then enable UFW if it is the assigned manager.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo ufw status verbose`

**✅ VERIFY:** Confirm UFW status/rules and test required client connections from another approved device.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Do not enable a deny-all policy before permitting a required SSH session; Debian may already use nftables.

#### 🎯 DT14 — Correct exposed /etc/shadow permissions

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Correct exposed /etc/shadow permissions.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Check ownership and mode using `stat -c '%a %U:%G %n' /etc/shadow`; if it is accessible to ordinary users, restore a supported Debian secure mode/group such as root:shadow with restrictive permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `ls -l /etc/shadow`

**✅ VERIFY:** Confirm nonprivileged users cannot read password hashes and system login still functions.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** A mode of `600` may already be secure; do not force `640` if the actual distribution profile requires something else.

#### 🎯 DT15 — Disable Apache only when web service is not required

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Disable Apache only when web service is not required.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Inspect `systemctl status apache2`, actual websites and README, then stop/disable Apache only if confirmed unneeded.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo systemctl disable --now apache2`

**✅ VERIFY:** Verify service state and make sure any other required web sites still work.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Never disable a required Apache service just because a training image treated it as unwanted.

#### 🎯 DT16 — Disable vsftpd only when FTP service is not required

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Disable vsftpd only when FTP service is not required.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Inspect the installed FTP server, startup state and README; stop and disable only when confirmed unnecessary.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo systemctl disable --now vsftpd`

**✅ VERIFY:** Recheck the unit and ensure any required file-transfer service remains functional.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** If FTP is critical, secure the service instead; don't purge its data or users.

#### 🎯 DT17 — Enable daily update-list refresh when required

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Enable daily update-list refresh when required.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Back up the applicable APT periodic configuration, then set `APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";` in the actual `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades` file when requested.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `grep -R 'APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists' /etc/apt/apt.conf.d 2>/dev/null`

**✅ VERIFY:** Verify the file setting and the relevant APT timer/update mechanism.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Daily repository-list refresh is not necessarily identical to automatically installing security updates.

#### 🎯 DT18 — Repair Debian security repositories and apply approved updates

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Repair Debian security repositories and apply approved updates.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Verify `/etc/os-release`, APT `.list` and `.sources` files match the Debian codename; repair only broken signed repositories, run `sudo apt update`, preview changes, and apply permitted updates.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `apt-cache policy && apt -s upgrade`

**✅ VERIFY:** Recheck update errors and required browser/SSH/application versions and functionality.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Never overwrite all repository sources from an old example, bypass signature checks, or automatically choose the wrong `sshd_config` on a dpkg prompt.

#### 🎯 DT19 — Preserve and update a required Chromium browser

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Preserve and update a required Chromium browser.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Check Chromium's installed package, browser launch, current repository version and README need. Update through approved signed Debian sources without removing the required browser.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `apt-cache policy chromium`

**✅ VERIFY:** Verify Chromium remains installed at the expected location and can launch.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** The training image specifically penalized removing its required browser; this is an image-specific dependency, not a universal package name.

#### 🎯 DT20 — Update OpenSSH while preserving required configuration

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Update OpenSSH while preserving required configuration.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Confirm OpenSSH server is required, record its service/auth settings, apply a reviewed security update, and carefully choose how to handle local sshd configuration during package prompts.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `apt-cache policy openssh-server`

**✅ VERIFY:** Validate `sshd -t` and perform a second authorized SSH login after the update.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Do not replace a working SSH configuration blindly; a security update should not disable a required login.

#### 🎯 DT21 — Remove only confirmed prohibited MP3/media files

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Remove only confirmed prohibited MP3/media files.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Locate the exact files, answer forensics questions, compare with the README's media prohibition, then remove only the specifically disallowed files after preserving recoverability.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `find /home -type f -iname '*.mp3' -print 2>/dev/null`

**✅ VERIFY:** Re-run the same targeted search and ensure evidence/required media remains.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Avoid `rm *.mp3` in a broad directory without checking file names; use a recoverable approach when possible.

#### 🎯 DT22 — Remove specifically prohibited games or diagnostic utilities

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Remove specifically prohibited games or diagnostic utilities.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Review installed AisleRiot, Wireshark or other named software against the actual README, preview dependencies and remove only packages explicitly prohibited for this image.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `apt -s purge aisleriot`

**✅ VERIFY:** Check package removal and confirm no required debugging/network tools or dependencies were affected.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Wireshark can be legitimately required in other scenarios; wildcard purges may remove unrelated packages.

#### 🎯 DT23 — Investigate a suspicious netcat persistence job

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Investigate a suspicious netcat persistence job.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Inspect root/user crontabs, timers and running processes, identify the exact scheduled executable and network listener, preserve evidence, then disable only a confirmed malicious task.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo crontab -l`

**✅ VERIFY:** Confirm the job cannot restart, its process is stopped, and no required service broke.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Do not run a copied PID kill or delete a system binary based solely on filename; first confirm actual process, package owner and provenance.

#### 🎯 DT24 — Disable remote root SSH login while keeping SSH available

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Disable remote root SSH login while keeping SSH available.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** If OpenSSH is a README-required service, record current auth, back up its real config and set `PermitRootLogin no` only when compatible; validate with `sshd -t` and reload when safe.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -T | grep permitrootlogin`

**✅ VERIFY:** Test a **second ordinary authorized SSH login** and recheck the effective root-login setting.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Do not disable SSH, password authentication or required admin access while trying to prevent direct root login.

#### 🎯 DT25 — Final checks after training-style changes

- [ ] **DO THIS only when relevant to the image README:** Final checks after training-style changes.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Debian Terminal:** Review score, saved forensic files, authorized accounts, PAM login, required apps, firewall, SSH, browser, AppArmor and service health. Complete only after confirming all README dependencies.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE CHECK / EXTRA INFORMATION — not an extra required fix**
>
> `systemctl --failed && sudo ss -lntup`

**✅ VERIFY:** Record any N/A item and recheck the current scoring report without editing scoring files.

> [!CAUTION]
> **⚠️ Extra context / rollback safety:** Individual training point values and answers cannot be assumed for another image.

### 2. Users and groups

#### 2.1 See every user on the computer
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.1 See every user on the computer**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Get the list of real (human) users and compare it with the README.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** **Menu → Administration → Users and Groups**. Enter your password. Every user is listed on the left with their account type (Administrator / Standard).

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
> ```bash
> awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $3 < 65534 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
> ```
> This prints every user with a user ID (UID) of 1000 or more, which means the real people.

#### 2.2 Delete users who are not in the README
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS (only if authorized) — 2.2 Delete users who are not in the README**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Remove each account that isn't listed as an authorized admin or user.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** An extra account is the easiest way for an attacker to get back in.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** In the installed desktop's account-management panel (for GNOME use **Settings → Users**, if available), select the user → click **Delete** (the "−" button) → keep or delete their files.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
> ```bash
> sudo userdel mallory          # delete the account (keeps /home/mallory for now)
> ```
>
**✅ Check it worked:** `id mallory` should say `no such user`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Check the spelling against the README **three times**. Deleting an authorized user is a penalty. Never delete yourself, `root`, or system accounts (UID below 1000 like `www-data`, `syslog`, `messagebus`).

#### 2.3 Create users the README says should exist
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.3 Create users the README says should exist**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** In GNOME, **Settings → Users → Unlock**; other desktops may have a different account utility..

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
> ```bash
> sudo adduser erin             # asks for a password and details
> ```

#### 2.4 Fix who is an administrator
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.4 Fix who is an administrator**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Only the README's admins should be in the `sudo` group (that's what "Administrator" means on Mint).

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** In the installed desktop's account-management panel (for GNOME use **Settings → Users**, if available), click the user, then set **Account type** to *Administrator* or *Standard*.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
> ```bash
> getent group sudo                       # who has sudo now
> sudo deluser bob sudo                   # take admin away from bob
> sudo usermod -aG sudo alice             # give admin to alice
> getent group adm                        # 'adm' can read logs - normally admins only
> ```
>
**✅ Check it worked:** `getent group sudo` lists only the README admins.

#### 2.5 Look for hidden root accounts and hidden users
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.5 Look for hidden root accounts and hidden users**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Find accounts with UID 0 (secret root copies), and accounts with a low UID that can still log in.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** `useradd -o -u 0 toor` makes a second root that doesn't show up in Users and Groups.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd                          # should print ONLY: root
awk -F: '$3 < 1000 && $7 !~ /(nologin|false|sync)$/ {print $1, $3, $7}' /etc/passwd
```
The second command lists low-UID accounts that have a real shell. Normally that's only `root` (and maybe `postgres` if PostgreSQL is installed).

**🛠️ Fix:**
```bash
sudo usermod --expiredate 1970-01-02 toor       # only after confirming this account is unauthorized; preserve evidence first
sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin mallory       # stop a hidden user from logging in
```

#### 2.6 Check other powerful groups
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.6 Check other powerful groups**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
for g in root shadow disk lxd docker sambashare; do getent group $g; done
```
`shadow` can read password hashes. `disk` can read the raw hard drive. `lxd` and `docker` can become root. Normal users shouldn't be in them:
```bash
sudo gpasswd -d carol shadow
```

#### 2.7 Give users strong passwords
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.7 Give users strong passwords**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Change every authorized user's password (except your own, unless the README says so) to something strong.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** Planted users often have passwords like `password` or `123456`.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** In GNOME, **Settings → Users → Unlock**; other desktops may have a different account utility..

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
> ```bash
> sudo passwd bob
> ```
> Use a strong unique password matching the README policy; do not record real credentials in this repository.g. `Blue-Train-42!x`. **Write it down.**

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't change your own password** unless the README asks. If you do, you must remember it, because the screen lock and `sudo` will ask for it.

#### 2.8 Debian root account: verify recovery **before** changing it
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.8 Debian root account: verify recovery **before** changing it**

Unlike Mint/Ubuntu, Debian may use a working root password installed intentionally. Inspect root state and required SSH restrictions without assuming a password-bearing root is automatically wrong:

```bash
sudo passwd -S root
getent passwd root
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -T 2>/dev/null | grep permitrootlogin
```

If `sudo` isn't available, run these from `su -` and omit sudo. **Do not execute `passwd -l root`** unless the README/policy explicitly requires it, a separate authorized admin login works, and VM console/recovery access is available. Locking the root password also affects `su -`.

#### 2.9 Accounts with no password
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.9 Accounts with no password**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Find accounts that have **no password at all**, so anyone can log in as them by just pressing Enter.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** An empty password is a common planted problem. Removing `nullok` (step 3.5) blocks these logins, but the account should still get a real password or be locked.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
sudo passwd -S -a | awk '$2 == "NP" {print $1}'   # NP = no password; should print nothing
sudo passwd bob                                    # README user: give them a strong password
sudo passwd -l mallory                             # account that shouldn't log in: lock it
```

**✅ Check it worked:** the first command prints nothing.

#### 2.10 Account inventory, privileged groups and safe verification
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 2.10 Account inventory, privileged groups and safe verification**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
getent passwd
getent group sudo
getent group adm
awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1 " UID=" $3 " SHELL=" $7}' /etc/passwd
sudo passwd -S -a
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpret:** Debian service accounts may have UIDs under 1000 and `nologin` shells; that alone is normal. The `sudo` group is not the only privilege path: review `/etc/sudoers.d/`, `root`, `disk`, `shadow`, `docker`, `lxd` and installed policies where relevant. A user's membership change may require a fresh login.

**Safe change order:** Verify account authorization against README, preserve any forensic evidence, keep your own admin access, remove a confirmed user's **unneeded group membership first**, and disable rather than delete a suspicious account until the correct identity is established. Do not delete user home data before forensics are complete.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore only the exact old group membership/account state from your notes; check login and sudo again.

### 3. Password and lockout policy

#### 3.1 Password aging defaults for **new** accounts
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 3.1 Password aging defaults for **new** accounts**

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Record the README-required password age/history/warning policy, then edit the `PASS_MAX_DAYS`, `PASS_MIN_DAYS`, and `PASS_WARN_AGE` defaults in `/etc/login.defs` **only if the scoring scenario requires it**.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
grep -E '^PASS_(MAX_DAYS|MIN_DAYS|WARN_AGE)' /etc/login.defs
sudo chage -l exampleuser
```

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
sudo cp -a /etc/login.defs /etc/login.defs.before-cp
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
```

If the README specifies 90 maximum days, 1 minimum day, and 14 days warning, set **those exact values**, not every example you find online:

```text
PASS_MAX_DAYS  90
PASS_MIN_DAYS  1
PASS_WARN_AGE  14
```

**Check/undo:** Repeat grep and `chage`; to restore, copy back the recorded `login.defs` backup. The defaults do not automatically change existing users.

#### 3.2 Apply aging to the users who already exist
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 3.2 Apply aging to the users who already exist**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why:** `login.defs` only affects **new** users.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 14 exampleuser
sudo chage -l bob            # check: "Maximum number of days" = 90
```

#### 3.3 Password complexity (pwquality)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 3.3 Password complexity (pwquality)**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Make Linux reject weak passwords when someone changes theirs.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality  # only if absent and required, after a successful apt update
sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf
```
Set (remove the `#` at the start of each line):
```
minlen = 12  # example only: follow README
ucredit = -1
lcredit = -1
dcredit = -1
ocredit = -1
difok = 3
maxrepeat = 3
usercheck = 1
dictcheck = 1
enforce_for_root
```
`-1` means "at least one" (upper case, lower case, digit, other symbol).

Also check the PAM line exists:
```bash
grep pwquality /etc/pam.d/common-password
```
It should look like: `password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 ...`. You can add the same options to the end of that line (`minlen=12 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1`).

#### 3.4 Password history (no re-using old passwords)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 3.4 Password history (no re-using old passwords)**

Use the supported `pam_pwhistory` procedure in [17.2](#172-password-aging-pam-and-lockout-without-breaking-login). Do not copy an old `pam_unix remember=` line across releases or append a duplicate module. Preserve the current PAM stack and test with an ordinary user before closing the recovery console.

#### 3.5 No logins with an empty password
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 3.5 No logins with an empty password**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Remove the word `nullok` from `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why:** `nullok` lets an account with an empty password log in without typing anything.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
grep nullok /etc/pam.d/common-auth
# Do not run a blind sed edit. Back up the existing PAM file, inspect control flow, then edit only the confirmed rule using sudo nano.
```

**✅ Check it worked:** `grep -c nullok /etc/pam.d/common-auth` prints `0`.

#### 3.6 Account lockout after failed logins (careful!)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 3.6 Account lockout after failed logins (careful!)**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Limit repeated invalid authentication attempts using a module supported by the installed release.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** Incorrect PAM control flow can deny all users or bypass policy. Package versions and authentication providers determine integration; release age alone is not a reliable module test.

Use [17.2's complete PAM backup, module discovery, lockout verification and recovery procedure](#172-password-aging-pam-and-lockout-without-breaking-login). Never replace the primary PAM block with a generic example or add obsolete pam_tally2 rules based solely on a version name. Keep a root console and test a separate ordinary user's actual password login.

---

#### 3.7 Debian PAM safe modification protocol and account-lockout checks
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 3.7 Debian PAM safe modification protocol and account-lockout checks**

**Before you modify PAM:** Have a confirmed root console or recovery method. Back up the **specific files** and inspect which modules are installed; do not paste a full PAM stack from a Mint or Ubuntu version into Debian.

```bash
dpkg-query -W libpam-runtime libpam-modules libpam-pwquality 2>/dev/null
sudo grep -nEv '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' /etc/pam.d/common-auth /etc/pam.d/common-password
sudo grep -RnsE 'pam_faillock|pam_pwhistory|pam_pwquality|pam_unix|pam_tally2|nullok' /etc/pam.d /etc/security 2>/dev/null
```

```bash
sudo cp -a /etc/pam.d/common-auth /etc/pam.d/common-auth.before-cp
sudo cp -a /etc/pam.d/common-password /etc/pam.d/common-password.before-cp
```

If Debian's `pam-auth-update` is installed, check the supported profiles and select only required modules using its interactive interface instead of duplicating `pam_unix.so` or inserting arbitrary module orders:

```bash
sudo pam-auth-update
```

`pam_faillock.so`, where supported and integrated, provides failed-login tracking; `pam_pwhistory.so` can prevent reuse. Their exact control flags and order **must match the installed Debian PAM implementation**; do not copy example snippets into production blindly. `pam_tally2` is obsolete on modern distributions. PAM lockout settings can affect service logins as well as interactive users.

**✅ Verification:** From a **second local console** or known working remote session, test normal user authentication, sudo elevation and an authorized password change. Check service logs and `faillock --user exampleuser` if the tool is present. Do not intentionally lock the only admin account.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the specific backed-up PAM files using the retained root/recovery console and retest. Do not disable all PAM checks as a generic repair.

### 4. Firewall

#### 4.1 Inspect existing firewall; install and enable UFW only when appropriate
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 4.1 Inspect existing firewall; install and enable UFW only when appropriate**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why:** Debian does not guarantee a particular firewall front end or default firewall state. The image may have no active host firewall, but it may already use native nftables or another manager. First inspect the actual active nftables/UFW/firewalld policy. The UFW commands below apply only if UFW is the chosen manager; do not enable a competing policy blindly. Establish required source/port exceptions before enabling default deny.

```bash
sudo nft list ruleset
sudo ss -lntup
sudo ufw status verbose  # only if ufw is installed
```
If `ufw` is absent and an authorized firewall change is required, first document existing rules and establish local console access. If no competing firewall manager is configured, you can choose UFW:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp  # ONLY if SSH on TCP 22 is required; verify actual port
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```
Prefer clicking? `sudo apt install gufw`, then open **Firewall Configuration**.

---

#### 4.2 Define rules by required service, **not** by a universal port list
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 4.2 Define rules by required service, **not** by a universal port list**

| Required service | Typical network port(s) | Debian firewall considerations |
|---|---|---|
| SSH | TCP 22 | Preserve management before enabling deny; may use another port |
| HTTP/HTTPS | TCP 80 / 443 | Only if required web clients need access |
| DNS | UDP/TCP 53 | Resolver-only localhost DNS does not require wide inbound access |
| DHCP server | UDP 67/68 | Broadcast/relay and interface context matter |
| Samba | TCP 445; sometimes TCP 139 / UDP 137–138 | Restrict to authorized local networks |
| FTP | TCP 21 + configured passive-data range | Allow exactly the server's real data-port range |
| MariaDB/MySQL | TCP 3306 | Prefer loopback when the DB is local; remote access only if required |
| PostgreSQL | TCP 5432 | Restrict authorized source networks; check `pg_hba.conf` |
| SMTP | TCP 25 / 587 | Only for a required mail role |

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
sudo ss -lntup
sudo ufw status numbered
sudo nft list ruleset
```

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

**✅ Verification:** Test each required service from an authorized client and compare with `ss` output; `ufw status` alone does not prove reachability.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** List numbered rules again before any `sudo ufw delete NUMBER`, and restore precisely the removed entry. Do not flush `nft` rules or reset UFW to solve one port conflict.

#### 4.3 Native nftables policy and fail-safe edit
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 4.3 Native nftables policy and fail-safe edit**

Debian may manage nftables natively. **Before editing** a rule set, read `systemctl status nftables` and `sudo nft list ruleset`; do **not** enable UFW in parallel with another active policy manager without understanding ownership.

```bash
sudo nft list ruleset
sudo systemctl status nftables --no-pager
```

If the README requires changes to a maintained native rules file, make a backup of the **actual** file first. A common Debian file is `/etc/nftables.conf`, but confirm the unit's `ExecStart` and includes. Validate a draft before applying:

```bash
sudo nft -c -f /etc/nftables.conf
```

An unsuccessful syntax check means **stop**. If remotely connected, use a permitted out-of-band console or a documented timed rollback plan to avoid being locked out. Verify required connections after approved reload. Do not run `nft flush ruleset` as a standard hardening step.

### 5. Updates

#### 5.1 Check the software sources
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 5.1 Check the software sources**

```bash
grep -rs '^[^#]' /etc/apt/sources.list*       # every source line, with the file it is in
```
The sources can be in `/etc/apt/sources.list` (one line per source: `deb http://... bookworm main`) or in a `.sources` file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` (blocks of `URIs:`, `Suites:`, `Components:` lines). Check both. Ignore backup copies (names ending in `.save`, `.bak` or `~`): apt only reads `sources.list` and the `.list` / `.sources` files.

For Debian 12 will normally use **`deb.debian.org/debian`** with **`bookworm`** and **`bookworm-updates`**, and **`security.debian.org/debian-security`** (or `deb.debian.org/debian-security`) with **`bookworm-security`**. Debian 13 uses `trixie`, Debian 12 uses `bookworm`, and Debian 11 uses `bullseye`; match the installed release and supported security pockets. The components are normally `main` (Debian 12 often adds `non-free-firmware`): that's fine.
- A missing **security** source means no security updates.
- Unrecognized third-party repos and `[trusted=yes]`/`Trusted: yes` bypasses warrant investigation; do not remove required signed vendor sources before verifying them.
- A **`deb cdrom:`** line makes `apt update` fail or ask for the install disc. Put a `#` in front of it (`sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list`).

#### 5.2 Install all updates
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 5.2 Install all updates**

```bash
sudo apt update
apt -s upgrade  # preview package changes first
sudo apt upgrade  # review the proposed changes before confirming
```
(GNOME's **Software** app also shows updates.)

#### 5.3 Turn on automatic updates
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 5.3 Turn on automatic updates**

```bash
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades       # answer Yes
cat /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
```
**✅ Check it worked:** the file has `APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";` and `APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";` (inspect other APT periodic directives too).

#### 5.4 Held packages
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 5.4 Held packages**

```bash
apt-mark showhold              # anything listed will never update
sudo apt-mark unhold firefox-esr        # change firefox-esr to each name the line above printed
```

#### 5.5 Update Firefox ESR and the README's apps
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 5.5 Update Firefox ESR and the README's apps**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** On Debian, Firefox is the package **`firefox-esr`** (there is no `firefox` package, so `apt install firefox` fails). Thunderbird, LibreOffice and the README's critical services also update through `apt`. Step 5.2 updates them all; if you skipped it or it failed, update the important ones on their own:
```bash
apt list --upgradable 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei 'firefox|thunderbird|libreoffice'   # anything listed is out of date
sudo apt install --only-upgrade firefox-esr thunderbird      # skips any that aren't installed
```
**✅ Check it worked:** run the `apt list --upgradable` may still list held, staged or otherwise not updated packages; review them, rather than assuming all packages must disappear.

#### 5.6 Debian 11/12/13 repository suites, deb822 files and safe update sequence
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 5.6 Debian 11/12/13 repository suites, deb822 files and safe update sequence**

**Release table (November 2026):**

| Installed OS | Codename | Security support | Correct action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debian 13 | `trixie` | Stable | Use trixie/trixie-security updates |
| Debian 12 | `bookworm` | LTS until June 2028 on eligible architectures/packages | Use bookworm/bookworm-security and LTS notices |
| Debian 11 | `bullseye` | Standard LTS ended Aug 31, 2026 | On a legacy competition image, preserve assigned release and research support without upgrading blindly |

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
apt-cache policy
sudo grep -RHE '^(deb |Types:|URIs:|Suites:|Components:|Signed-By:)' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d 2>/dev/null
apt-mark showhold
sudo dpkg --audit
```

For `.sources` deb822 files, verify `Suites:`, `URIs:` and `Signed-By:` rather than expecting one-line `deb ...` entries. **Do not** mix Ubuntu, Mint, testing, unstable and stable repositories without explicit need.

**If APT reports an error:** Diagnose DNS, time, mirror connectivity, invalid signatures, pinned/held packages and package-manager activity. Never set `Trusted: yes` to silence a signature error. Preview before applying an upgrade:

```bash
sudo apt update
apt -s upgrade
```

**Recovery:** Restore only the edited sources list or `.sources` file from backup, rerun `apt update`, then separately assess any packages already upgraded. A sources file rollback alone does not downgrade packages. Never remove dpkg lock files while an actual apt/dpkg process is operating.

### 📦 signed APT sources and Debian LTS package coverage

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Verify security support for the installed release **and individual required packages**.

~~~bash
cat /etc/os-release
apt-cache policy
apt-mark showhold
sudo dpkg --audit
sudo grep -RHE '^(deb |Types:|URIs:|Suites:|Components:|Signed-By:)' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d 2>/dev/null
~~~

Debian 12/13 sources can be **deb822 .sources** files. Never mix Ubuntu or Mint repositories into Debian, add Trusted: yes to bypass signatures, or change the codename to trixie just because it is stable.

**Optional read-only LTS check (only if tool is installed):**

~~~bash
command -v check-support-status
check-support-status
~~~

The tool comes from the Debian package **debian-security-support**. If absent, investigate availability via signed APT sources only when permitted. Bookworm LTS does not guarantee that every possible installed package has support. **Do not remove a README-required package because a generic security checklist flags it.** Confirm actual advisory and functionality.

**Verification/undo:** Recheck apt sources/policies and normal application function. Restoring sources files does not downgrade packages already upgraded; avoid a release-wide upgrade during a scored round.

<a id="research-expansion-early-account-service-and-persistence-inventory"></a>
### 🔐 early account, service and persistence inventory

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
getent passwd
getent group sudo
awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1, $3, $7}' /etc/passwd
sudo visudo -c
~~~

Compare real UID 0 and sudoers privileges against the README, preserving service identities. For services:

~~~bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
sudo ss -lntup
systemctl list-timers --all
sudo crontab -l
sudo journalctl -p warning -n 50 --no-pager
~~~

A service may start through a timer/socket even if its unit is disabled. Native nftables may be the firewall owner rather than UFW. Record suspicious process/path/hash and evidence before disabling or deleting anything.

**✅ Verification:** A new authorized user login, working sudo, required SSH/web/database/share client tests, correct firewall rules, and current score. Restore only the last proven breaking change.


<a id="research-report-expansion-d-r1--authorized-users-uid-0-sudo-and-root-recovery"></a>
### 🔐 Authorized users, UID 0, sudo and root recovery

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 🔐 Authorized users, UID 0, sudo and root recovery**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Community training categories and vendor-supported Linux administration. Debian is covered here as training material; the report does **not** establish it was a scored recent online-round image.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why:** Extra human users, duplicate UID 0 accounts, unauthorized sudo rules and an unexpectedly usable root login can create privileged access. Debian may legitimately have **root with a password and no sudo**, depending on installation choices.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** On Debian GNOME (when installed): **Settings → Users → Unlock** for human accounts; system/service users and sudoers require Terminal. A server without GUI is normal.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ~~~bash
> getent passwd
> getent group sudo
> getent group adm
> awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1 " UID=" $3 " SHELL=" $7}' /etc/passwd
> sudo passwd -S root
> sudo grep -RnsE 'NOPASSWD|!authenticate|^[[:space:]]*%sudo' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d 2>/dev/null
> ~~~
>
If sudo is unavailable, switch to an authorized **su -** root console and omit the sudo prefix. A low UID with a nologin shell is often a required service account.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ~~~bash
> sudo usermod -L EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED_USER
> sudo usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED_USER
> ~~~
>
Locking the password does **not** necessarily block SSH keys, existing sessions or all authentication methods; investigate those separately. To remove a verified unauthorized sudo group grant:

~~~bash
sudo gpasswd -d EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED_USER sudo
~~~

**✅ Verification:**

~~~bash
id EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED_USER
getent group sudo
sudo passwd -S EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED_USER
sudo visudo -c
~~~

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the user's actual previous shell (not blindly /bin/bash), group membership and original password lock state via **usermod -U** only if it was previously unlocked and the README requires it. Do not lock root until another admin/recovery path has been tested. Deleting a user with **userdel -r** may destroy forensic evidence and home data.

### 🔐 Password aging, PAM complexity and suspected PAM tampering

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 🔐 Password aging, PAM complexity and suspected PAM tampering**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Community/vendor-supported PAM and chage management; numeric training baselines are **examples only**.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
grep -E '^PASS_(MAX_DAYS|MIN_DAYS|WARN_AGE)' /etc/login.defs
sudo chage -l EXAMPLE_AUTHORIZED_USER
sudo grep -nEv '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' /etc/pam.d/common-password /etc/pam.d/common-auth
dpkg -V libpam-runtime libpam-modules
sudo grep -RnsE 'pam_exec|pam_permit|pam_debug|pam_pwquality|pam_pwhistory|pam_faillock' /etc/pam.d 2>/dev/null
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **What to look for:** Wrong aging, duplicate PAM modules, unexpected pam_exec or pam_permit, or a changed packaged PAM file. **dpkg -V output isn't proof of malware**: package conffiles and permitted local policy may legitimately differ; compare with vendor files and README.

**Before a PAM edit (from a working root/recovery console):**

~~~bash
sudo cp -a /etc/pam.d/common-auth /etc/pam.d/common-auth.before-cp
sudo cp -a /etc/pam.d/common-password /etc/pam.d/common-password.before-cp
~~~

**Change (only when README explicitly requires, example 90 max / 1 min / 7 warning):**

~~~bash
sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 7 EXAMPLE_AUTHORIZED_USER
~~~

For password quality/history, first check installed **libpam-pwquality**, **pam-auth-update** profiles and the exact Debian PAM stack. Edit the correct supported module/options with **sudo pam-auth-update** or careful editor inspection. **Never paste a generic complete PAM block or add arbitrary new control flags.**

**✅ Verification:**

~~~bash
sudo chage -l EXAMPLE_AUTHORIZED_USER
sudo visudo -c
~~~

Also test an authorized ordinary user's actual password login, sudo, and password change in a **separate new session**, while retaining the admin/root console.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore exact old chage settings and previously backed-up individual PAM files using the retained root/recovery session; test login before closing it. Do not replace /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow wholesale without a validated rescue plan.

### 📦 Debian APT source integrity, security suites and unattended upgrades

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 📦 Debian APT source integrity, security suites and unattended upgrades**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Debian vendor-backed; the report notes old codenames and community repository replacement advice are unreliable across releases.

**Check installed release and ALL active .list/.sources entries:**

~~~bash
cat /etc/os-release
apt-cache policy
sudo grep -RHE '^(deb |Types:|URIs:|Suites:|Components:|Signed-By:|Trusted:)' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d 2>/dev/null
apt-mark showhold
sudo dpkg --audit
~~~

**Debian release difference:** Debian 12 = bookworm / bookworm-security; Debian 13 = trixie / trixie-security. Use only suites for the **actual OS release** and required signed sources. Debian 11 has legacy support caveats; **do not upgrade the OS release during a competition without instructions**.

**Backup before a specific change:** For an actual source file, copy that file to a unique private backup via **sudo cp -a SOURCE SOURCE.before-cp**, then use **sudo nano SOURCE**. Never add **Trusted: yes** or **[trusted=yes]** merely to stop signature errors.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
sudo apt update
apt -s upgrade
systemctl status apt-daily-upgrade.timer --no-pager
dpkg-query -W unattended-upgrades 2>/dev/null
~~~

**Change only when the README requires an enabled/working automatic security-update mechanism and it is absent:**

~~~bash
sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
~~~

**✅ Verification:** Inspect **/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades**, configured allowed origins, **apt-daily-upgrade.timer**, and **/var/log/unattended-upgrades/** where present. Run **sudo dpkg --audit** and inspect held packages. A timer can be inactive except while its task is running.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore only the modified repository or APT configuration file(s) from backups; installed package downgrades are a separate operation. Do not delete dpkg lock files while another package manager is running.

<a id="research-report-expansion-d-r4--nftables-versus-ufw-configuration-validation-and-recovery"></a>
### 🛡️ nftables versus UFW, configuration validation and recovery

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 🛡️ nftables versus UFW, configuration validation and recovery**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Debian vendor-backed; Debian commonly uses nftables as the modern packet-filtering framework but does not guarantee a universal preinstalled firewall manager.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
sudo ss -lntup
sudo nft list ruleset
systemctl status nftables --no-pager
command -v ufw
~~~

If UFW is installed, separately:

~~~bash
sudo ufw status verbose
sudo ufw status numbered
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **What to check:** Is native nftables, UFW, firewalld or another manager controlling access? Which SSH/web/DNS/DHCP/database ports are README-required? Do not enable conflicting firewalls or apply deny-all before preserving remote-console access.

**Before editing a native nftables configuration:** Identify its real unit/includes; the common default is **/etc/nftables.conf** but it may not be the active file. Preserve exact file:

~~~bash
sudo cp -a /etc/nftables.conf /etc/nftables.conf.before-cp
~~~

**Fix only when the required change is approved:** Use **sudo nano /etc/nftables.conf** and edit precisely the relevant chain/rule, then validate syntax **before** applying:

~~~bash
sudo nft -c -f /etc/nftables.conf
~~~

If syntax passes and an approved console/rollback path exists, apply only the reviewed ruleset:

~~~bash
sudo nft -f /etc/nftables.conf
~~~

**✅ Verification:** Re-run **sudo nft list ruleset** and test every required client connection from an authorized separate host; a syntax pass cannot guarantee connectivity.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore **the previously saved exact rules file** using local/recovery console, validate it, then reapply it. Avoid **nft flush ruleset** as a casual rollback; it removes filtering and is not a secure final state.

## Part 4 — Services, Software, Desktop and Persistence

> [!TIP]
> ⚙️ **Service-aware work:** Check required applications and dependencies before adjusting settings.


Check required services and suspicious programs, login configuration, SSH, filesystem privileges, sudo, timers, auditing and AppArmor.

### 6. Services

#### 6.1 See what's running and listening
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 6.1 See what's running and listening**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
sudo ss -tulpn             # programs listening on network ports
```

#### 6.2 Turn off services the README doesn't need
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 6.2 Turn off services the README doesn't need**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now vsftpd        # stop it now AND at boot
sudo apt purge vsftpd                      # remove it completely (if the README doesn't need it)
```

| Service | Package | Usually… |
|---|---|---|
| Telnet server | `telnetd`, `inetutils-telnetd` | **Remove** (sends passwords in plain text) |
| FTP server | `vsftpd`, `proftpd-core`, `pure-ftpd` | Remove unless the README needs FTP |
| Web server | `apache2`, `nginx` | Remove unless the README needs it |
| Database | `mysql-server`, `mariadb-server`, `postgresql` | Remove unless needed |
| Samba | `samba` | Remove unless file sharing is needed |
| SNMP | `snmpd` | Remove |
| NFS | `nfs-kernel-server`, `rpcbind` | Remove unless needed |
| Printing | `cups` | Disable unless printing is needed |
| Avahi (network discovery) | `avahi-daemon` | Disable |
| VNC / remote desktop | `x11vnc`, `vino`, `xrdp` | Remove unless needed |
| DNS server | `bind9` | Remove unless the README needs DNS |
| Mail server | `postfix`, `dovecot-core` | Remove unless the README needs mail |
| Web proxy | `squid` | Remove unless needed |
| Old insecure servers | `tftpd-hpa`, `xinetd`, `openbsd-inetd`, `rsh-server`, `nis` | **Remove** |
| SSH server | `openssh-server` | Keep **only** if the README mentions SSH |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never** turn off a service the README lists as critical. Disabling a critical service is a penalty on almost every image.

#### 6.3 Make sure the critical services are running
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 6.3 Make sure the critical services are running**

```bash
systemctl status ssh             # "active (running)" in green = good
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh  # start it if it isn't
```

---

#### 6.4 Discover installed units and required dependencies
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 6.4 Discover installed units and required dependencies**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
sudo ss -lntup
sudo systemctl --failed
```

For one service seen in the list:

```bash
systemctl status example.service --no-pager
systemctl cat example.service
systemctl list-dependencies example.service
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpretation:** `disabled` means the service is not enabled to start directly at boot; **socket activation, timers or dependencies** can start it. `active (exited)` can be legitimate for oneshot units. A listener is not proof of wrongdoing; identify package, process and README purpose first.

**Manual disabling only for a confirmed unwanted service:**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now example.service
```

**Verify/undo:** Repeat status, listener inventory and required-client tests. To undo, restore the **recorded previous** enabled/running state, not blindly `enable --now` for every service. Do not purge the package until forensic evidence and installed dependencies are assessed.

### 7. Prohibited software and files

#### 7.1 Investigate prohibited software before uninstalling
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 7.1 Investigate prohibited software before uninstalling**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Status} ${Version}\n' 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei '(^|[- ])(nmap|wireshark|john|hydra|aircrack|hashcat|nikto|sqlmap|netcat|socat|tcpdump)'
command -v nc
command -v nmap
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **What to do:** Compare findings with the exact prohibited and required lists in the README. Network diagnostic packages such as `tcpdump` or `nmap` can be legitimate; package names alone are not proof of a scored issue. For one **confirmed disallowed** package, preview removing it:

```bash
apt -s purge example-package
```

Only if the preview does not remove critical dependencies and forensic evidence is saved:

```bash
sudo apt purge example-package
```

**✅ Verification:** `dpkg-query -W example-package`, the relevant command's path, normal service connectivity, and the score. **↩️ Undo:** Reinstall the verified original package/version from signed repositories if required; purging can also remove its configuration, so restore configuration backups as necessary.

#### 7.2 Games
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 7.2 Games**

```bash
dpkg -l | grep -Ei 'aisleriot|gnome-mines|gnome-sudoku|mahjongg|minetest|supertux|freeciv|0ad|wesnoth|bsdgames|steam'
# Review installed package and dependencies first; do not mass-purge: sudo apt purge aisleriot gnome-mines
```

#### 7.3 File-sharing and remote-access programs
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 7.3 File-sharing and remote-access programs**

```bash
dpkg -l | grep -Ei 'transmission|qbittorrent|deluge|frostwire|teamviewer|anydesk|x11vnc|tightvnc|vino'
flatpak list 2>/dev/null       # Mint's own app store installs flatpaks
snap list 2>/dev/null          # Mint has no snap unless someone added it
```
> [!NOTE]
> Mint installs **Transmission** (a torrent program) by default. Remove it unless the README needs it: `# Review installed package and dependencies first; do not mass-purge: sudo apt purge transmission-gtk transmission-common`

#### 7.4 Media files (music and video)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 7.4 Media files (music and video)**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
sudo find /home /root /tmp /srv /opt /var/www -type f \( -iname '*.mp3' -o -iname '*.mp4' -o -iname '*.wav' -o -iname '*.avi' -o -iname '*.mkv' -o -iname '*.mov' -o -iname '*.flac' -o -iname '*.ogg' -o -iname '*.wma' -o -iname '*.m4a' \) 2>/dev/null
sudo rm "/home/bob/Music/song.mp3"
```

> [!WARNING]
> Check the forensics questions first. A question might ask about one of these files.

#### 7.5 Other files that break policy
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 7.5 Other files that break policy**

Password lists, credit card or social security number files, packet captures (`.pcap`), and hacking scripts:
```bash
sudo find /home /root /tmp /opt -type f \( -iname '*password*' -o -iname '*.pcap' -o -iname '*creditcard*' -o -iname '*.kdbx' \) 2>/dev/null
sudo ls -la /home/*/ /tmp /var/tmp /opt     # look for anything odd, including hidden .files
```

---

#### 7.6 Debian-specific prohibited software review and forensic preservation
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 7.6 Debian-specific prohibited software review and forensic preservation**

**Check installed GNOME games** (some are bundled in desktop metapackages; removing the metapackage can have unexpected effects):

```bash
dpkg -l | grep -Ei 'gnome-games|aisleriot|gnome-mines|gnome-sudoku|mahjongg|chess|steam|transmission|qbittorrent'
```

**Search user-space files without deleting anything:**

```bash
find /home /root /tmp /var/tmp -type f \( -iname '*.mp3' -o -iname '*.mp4' -o -iname '*.avi' -o -iname '*.torrent' \) -print 2>/dev/null
```

**Investigate a suspicious file:**

```bash
file /path/to/suspicious-file
stat /path/to/suspicious-file
sha256sum /path/to/suspicious-file
```

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Screenshots, forensics evidence, user-required media and authorized program files may match these patterns. Do not run wildcard `rm`, indiscriminately purge packages, or remove the desktop metapackage simply because a game appeared in the listing.

### 8. Login screen and screen lock

#### 8.1 No automatic login (GDM)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 8.1 No automatic login (GDM)**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** **Settings → Users** → **Unlock** → turn off **Automatic Login** for every user.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
> ```bash
> sudo nano /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf
> ```
> In `[daemon]`:
> ```
> AutomaticLoginEnable=false
> TimedLoginEnable=false
> ```
> In `[security]`: `DisallowTCP=true`.

#### 8.2 Screen lock
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS (only if authorized) — 8.2 Screen lock**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** **Settings → Privacy → Screen** (Debian 11: **Privacy → Screen Lock**): **Blank Screen Delay: 5 minutes**, **Automatic Screen Lock: On**, **Automatic Screen Lock Delay: Screen Turns Off**.

**Check** (in a terminal as **your own user**, not after `su -` or with `sudo`: as root, `gsettings` shows root's settings, not yours):
```bash
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled     # true
gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay           # uint32 300
```

#### 8.3 Hide the list of users on the login screen
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 8.3 Hide the list of users on the login screen**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Make the GDM login screen ask for a user name instead of showing every account.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** The list tells anyone at the keyboard which accounts exist, so they only have to guess a password.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
# Use sudo nano on the actual installed GDM greeter dconf defaults; inspect and back up first
grep disable-user-list /etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults      # disable-user-list=true, with no # in front
```
Or by hand: `sudo nano /etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults`, find `[org/gnome/login-screen]` and delete the `#` in front of `disable-user-list=true` (add the line under that heading if it isn't there).

**✅ Check it worked:** the `grep` line above. The login screen changes after the next restart.

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't run `systemctl restart gdm` to see it sooner: that logs you out at once, and anything unsaved (like a forensics answer) is lost.

---

#### 8.4 Other Debian desktop environments and remote-desktop tools
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 8.4 Other Debian desktop environments and remote-desktop tools**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
systemctl status display-manager --no-pager
dpkg-query -W gdm3 lightdm sddm xrdp vino x11vnc 2>/dev/null
loginctl list-sessions
```

GNOME generally uses GDM and GNOME `gsettings`; KDE often uses SDDM, Xfce may use LightDM. A CLI/server image has no login screen. Inspect the real display manager before editing any GDM-specific file.

**Remote desktop:** In GNOME **Settings → Sharing** (or the installed version's Remote Desktop pane), inspect only if GNOME is installed. Check any `xrdp`, VNC, desktop sharing and remote-assistance services for README requirements.

**Check/undo:** From the signed-in desktop account, record `gsettings get` values before changing the corresponding key. Test **screen lock/unlock in a second authorized session** where possible. Do not restart GDM/lightdm to test while unsaved forensic work exists.

### 9. SSH server (only if installed)

```bash
dpkg -l openssh-server       # "ii" at the start = installed
```

#### 9.1 SSH not required? Investigate before disabling
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 9.1 SSH not required? Investigate before disabling**

```bash
dpkg-query -W openssh-server 2>/dev/null
systemctl status ssh --no-pager
systemctl status ssh.socket --no-pager
sudo ss -lntp
```

If SSH is confirmed unnecessary by README and no remote session depends on it, record the original unit/socket state, then disable precisely the applicable service/socket. **Do not purge SSH or change the listening port to force a scoring increase.**

#### 9.2 Needed? Make it safe.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 9.2 Needed? Make it safe.**

```bash
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `PermitRootLogin` | `no` | Nobody logs in directly as root |
| `PermitEmptyPasswords` | `no` | No logins without a password |
| `MaxAuthTries` | `4` | Fewer password guesses per connection |
| `X11Forwarding` | `no` | Don't forward the desktop |
| `LoginGraceTime` | `60` | Drop slow, half-finished logins |
| `ClientAliveInterval` | `300` | Probe whether the encrypted client connection is responsive |
| `ClientAliveCountMax` | `3` | (with the line above) |
| `HostbasedAuthentication` | `no` | Old, weak login method |
| `IgnoreRhosts` | `yes` | Old, weak login method |
| `PermitUserEnvironment` | `no` | Users can't change SSH's environment |
| `AllowTcpForwarding` | `no` | No tunnelling through this computer |
| `LogLevel` | `VERBOSE` | Better logs |
| `Banner` | `/etc/issue.net` | Show a warning before login |

Then test and reload:
```bash
sudo sshd -t && sudo systemctl reload ssh       # sshd -t prints nothing if the file is OK
```
If `sshd -t` says **Missing privilege separation directory: /run/sshd**, SSH is stopped right now: run `sudo mkdir -p /run/sshd` and test again.

**✅ Check it worked:** `sudo sshd -T | grep -Ei 'permitrootlogin|permitemptypasswords|maxauthtries'` shows `permitrootlogin no`, `permitemptypasswords no` and `maxauthtries 4`.

> [!WARNING]
> Leave `PasswordAuthentication yes` unless the README says otherwise. First prove that each required user has a working permitted authentication method in a separate connection; otherwise disabling passwords can lock them out.

#### 9.3 Check for override files
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 9.3 Check for override files**

Files in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/` are read **first**, and for SSH the first value wins, so they override everything above:
```bash
grep -r . /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ 2>/dev/null
sudo sshd -T | grep -Ei 'permitrootlogin|permitemptypasswords|passwordauthentication'   # the settings actually in use
```

#### 9.4 Planted SSH keys
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 9.4 Planted SSH keys**

```bash
sudo find / -name 'authorized_keys*' 2>/dev/null -exec ls -la {} \; -exec cat {} \;
```
Record key fingerprints and compare them with the README and known administrators. Root keys can be legitimate management credentials. Back up the file and remove only the confirmed unauthorized key line, then test required users again.

sudo grep -RnsE '^[[:space:]]*(Include|Match|Port|PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|KbdInteractiveAuthentication|AllowUsers|PubkeyAuthentication)' /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d 2>/dev/null
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -t
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -T | grep -Ei '^(port|permitrootlogin|passwordauthentication|pubkeyauthentication)'
```

`sshd -t` reports syntax errors; `-T` shows an effective general configuration but `Match` conditions may alter it for a particular user/client. **Do not** disable password authentication before an authorized SSH key and **a second login session** are confirmed.

**Change (only when required):** First copy the **actual edited** file to a unique backup, then open `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` or the applicable included file. Run `sshd -t` before `sudo systemctl reload ssh`. Verify SSH from another authorized client **while original session remains open**.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the edited config from its actual backup using local console and reload SSH. Check ssh.socket if present; Debian's unit behavior depends on release and package configuration.

### 11. File permissions and ownership

#### 11.1 Password files
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 11.1 Password files**

```bash
ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/group /etc/gshadow
sudo chmod 644 /etc/passwd /etc/group
sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow /etc/gshadow
sudo chown root:shadow /etc/shadow /etc/gshadow
```

**✅ Check it worked:** run the `ls -l` line again: `passwd` and `group` show `-rw-r--r-- root root`, `shadow` and `gshadow` show `-rw-r----- root shadow`.

#### 11.2 SUID programs (run as root for anyone)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 11.2 SUID programs (run as root for anyone)**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why:** If `find`, `vim`, `bash` or `python3` has the SUID bit, any user can become root with one command.

```bash
sudo find / -xdev -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
sudo chmod u-s /usr/bin/find
```
Normal SUID programs include `passwd`, `sudo`, `su`, `mount`, `umount`, `chsh`, `chfn`, `gpasswd`, `newgrp`, `pkexec`, `fusermount3` and `ssh-keysign`. Look up anything else.

#### 11.3 Files anyone can change
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 11.3 Files anyone can change**

```bash
sudo find / -xdev -type f -perm -0002 ! -path '/proc/*' ! -path '/sys/*' 2>/dev/null
sudo chmod o-w /path/to/file
```

**✅ Check it worked:** the `find` line prints nothing (files inside `/tmp` are OK).

#### 11.4 Home folders
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 11.4 Home folders**

```bash
ls -ld /home/*
sudo chmod 750 /home/bob        # other users can't look inside
```

**✅ Check it worked:** in `ls -ld /home/*` every folder ends in `---`, e.g. `drwxr-x--- bob bob`. Each folder should also belong to its own user (`sudo chown bob: /home/bob` fixes one that doesn't).

---

#### 11.5 System account files, capabilities and ACL review
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 11.5 System account files, capabilities and ACL review**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
stat -c '%A %a %U:%G %n' /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/shadow /etc/gshadow
sudo find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin -xdev -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
sudo find /home /tmp /var/tmp -xdev -type f -perm /0002 -ls 2>/dev/null
command -v getcap && sudo getcap -r /usr/bin /usr/sbin 2>/dev/null
```

Files such as `/etc/shadow` should be unreadable by ordinary users, but **exact ownership and group/mode vary by Debian configuration**. `SUID` and `world-writable` entries require investigation; don't remove every SUID bit automatically or recursively change ownership of `/usr`, `/var`, home directories or web roots.

**Check/undo:** Determine package ownership with `dpkg -S /path`, inspect `getfacl` if installed, and record `stat` before any narrow change. Restore specific owner/mode if the service/login breaks.

---

### 12. Sudo rules

#### 12.1 Check /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 12.1 Check /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
sudo cat /etc/sudoers
sudo ls -la /etc/sudoers.d/ && sudo cat /etc/sudoers.d/*
```
Look for:
- `NOPASSWD`: sudo without a password. Remove it.
- Lines giving a **normal user** `ALL=(ALL) ALL`.
- `Defaults !authenticate`. Remove it.

**Edit only with visudo** (it checks for mistakes before saving):
```bash
sudo visudo                          # main file
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/90-bob # a file in sudoers.d
```

> [!CAUTION]
> A typo in sudoers can break `sudo` for everyone. That's why you **always** use `visudo`.

---

#### 12.2 Safe sudoers modification and syntax verification
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 12.2 Safe sudoers modification and syntax verification**

```bash
sudo visudo -c
sudo grep -RnsE 'NOPASSWD|ALL=|%sudo|%admin' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d 2>/dev/null
```

To edit one include file, use `sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/ACTUAL-FILE` after recording a backup and checking the authorized admin list. `visudo` validates syntax on save; repeat `sudo visudo -c` and test in a second login.

**Recovery:** Use retained root shell or VM console to restore the specific file if sudo fails. Do not grant passwordless `ALL` to a student simply to make commands work.

---

### 13. Backdoors and malware

#### 13.1 Scheduled jobs (cron)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.1 Scheduled jobs (cron)**

```bash
sudo ls -la /var/spool/cron/crontabs/                  # one file per user
for u in $(cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd); do sudo crontab -l -u $u 2>/dev/null | grep -v '^#' | sed "s/^/$u: /"; done
cat /etc/crontab; ls -la /etc/cron.d /etc/cron.hourly /etc/cron.daily
sudo atq 2>/dev/null                                   # one-off "at" jobs (remove one: sudo atrm 3)
systemctl list-timers --all                            # systemd timers: another kind of scheduled job
```
Red flags: `nc`, `ncat`, `bash -i`, `/dev/tcp/`, `curl ... | bash`, `wget`, `base64 -d`, `python -c`, files in `/tmp`.

**🛠️ Fix:** `sudo crontab -e -u bob` (delete the line), or `sudo rm /etc/cron.d/badfile`.

#### 13.2 Services that start a backdoor at boot
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.2 Services that start a backdoor at boot**

```bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
ls -la /etc/systemd/system/ | grep -v '\.wants'
```
For any unit you don't recognise: `systemctl cat name.service` shows what it runs. Remove a bad one:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now evil.service && sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/evil.service && sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### 13.3 Programs listening for connections
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.3 Programs listening for connections**

```bash
sudo ss -tulpn
```
`nc`, `ncat`, `socat`, `python`, `perl` or `bash` listening on a port is almost always a backdoor. Note the PID, stop it (`sudo kill -9 PID`), **then find what starts it** (13.1, 13.2, 13.4).

#### 13.4 Start-up files and fake commands
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.4 Start-up files and fake commands**

```bash
cat /etc/rc.local 2>/dev/null
ls /etc/profile.d/
grep -n 'alias' /home/*/.bashrc /root/.bashrc /etc/bash.bashrc
```
Watch for aliases that hijack commands, e.g. `alias sudo='...'` or `alias ls='...'`. Also check `/usr/local/bin` for programs named like system commands (a fake `ls` or `sudo`).

#### 13.5 The hosts file
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.5 The hosts file**

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
Localhost, hostname and README-required internal mappings can all be legitimate. Back up `/etc/hosts`, compare each mapping with the scenario, and comment only confirmed unauthorized overrides using `sudo nano /etc/hosts`. Test the actual required hostname afterwards; an unfamiliar address alone is not proof of an attacker.

**✅ Check it worked:** `grep -v '^#' /etc/hosts` shows only the normal lines.

#### 13.6 Hidden root-kit tricks
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.6 Hidden root-kit tricks**

```bash
cat /etc/ld.so.preload 2>/dev/null          # should not exist or be empty
grep -n 'pam_permit' /etc/pam.d/common-auth # "auth sufficient pam_permit.so" = anyone can log in
```

#### 13.7 Programs that start when someone logs in
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.7 Programs that start when someone logs in**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** **Menu → Preferences → Startup Applications**.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>

#### 13.8 Tampered system programs
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.8 Tampered system programs**

```bash
sudo dpkg --verify | grep -v ' c '           # takes a minute or two; lines with a 5 = changed file
```
Fix by reinstalling the package that owns it: `dpkg -S /usr/bin/ls`, then `sudo apt install --reinstall coreutils`.

#### 13.9 Malware scanners (optional, slow)
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.9 Malware scanners (optional, slow)**

```bash
sudo apt install clamav rkhunter chkrootkit
sudo systemctl stop clamav-freshclam      # the updater service blocks a manual update while it runs
sudo freshclam                            # download the newest virus list
sudo systemctl start clamav-freshclam
sudo clamscan -ri /home                   # -r = every subfolder, -i = list only infected files
sudo rkhunter --check --sk                # --sk = don't stop for Enter after each part
sudo chkrootkit | grep INFECTED           # nothing printed = nothing found
```
These tools only **report**. Look at each file they name (forensics first!) before you delete it. Warnings from `rkhunter` and `chkrootkit` are often false alarms (for example `Linux.Xor.DDoS` for a harmless script in `/tmp`); `sudo less /var/log/rkhunter.log` shows the details.

---

#### 13.10 Correlate cron, systemd, login hooks and suspicious binaries
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 13.10 Correlate cron, systemd, login hooks and suspicious binaries**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
sudo cat /etc/crontab
sudo ls -la /etc/cron.d /etc/cron.daily /etc/cron.hourly
sudo crontab -l
systemctl list-timers --all
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
sudo ss -lntup
```

For one **identified** service:

```bash
systemctl cat example.service
systemctl show example.service -p FragmentPath -p ExecStart -p User
sudo journalctl -u example.service -n 80 --no-pager
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpret:** Unknown scheduled commands, user-writable executable paths, recently created unit files and unexpected network listeners deserve investigation, but package timers and update services can be legitimate. Preserve exact tasks/configuration first; do not run suspicious jobs or `systemctl enable` them as a test.

**Check/undo:** After an authorized narrow disable, verify the original critical service still functions, inspect logs and refresh score. Restore only that specific original timer/service if later found required.

---

### 14. Logging and auditing

#### 14.1 System logs and the audit daemon
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 14.1 System logs and the audit daemon**

```bash
sudo apt install auditd rsyslog
sudo systemctl enable --now auditd rsyslog
```
Add audit rules that record changes to the password files:
```bash
echo '-w /etc/passwd -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/shadow -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/group -p wa -k identity
-w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k sudoers' | sudo tee /etc/audit/rules.d/50-practice.rules
sudo augenrules --load
```

**✅ Check it worked:** `systemctl is-active auditd rsyslog` prints `active` twice, and `sudo auditctl -l` lists the `-w /etc/passwd` rules.

---

#### 14.2 Debian journal, rsyslog, auditd and log-retention checks
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 14.2 Debian journal, rsyslog, auditd and log-retention checks**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
sudo journalctl --list-boots
sudo journalctl -p warning -n 50 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u ssh --since today --no-pager
systemctl status systemd-journald rsyslog auditd --no-pager
ls -ld /var/log/journal
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **What to know:** Debian journal data may be volatile or persistent according to systemd-journald configuration; do not assume a missing `/var/log/auth.log` means disabled logging. `rsyslog` generates text log files on installations configured to use it. `auditd` can supply additional security events if installed and configured.

**Change, only if required and signed packages are available:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rsyslog auditd
```

**🔎 Check:** Inspect relevant units, configured journald retention, current boot log, service-specific errors and, if present, `/var/log/auth.log`. Do not clear audit logs or set unlimited log storage in an undersized competition VM.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** If newly installed logging components cause unexpected failures, diagnose their configuration first. Restore only an explicitly changed config; retain required audit logs.

---

### 15. AppArmor

#### 15.1 Make sure AppArmor is on
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 15.1 Make sure AppArmor is on**

```bash
sudo aa-status
sudo systemctl enable --now apparmor
```
If a profile is in **complain** mode for no reason, enforce it (needs `sudo apt install apparmor-utils`):
```bash
sudo aa-enforce /usr/bin/man      # change /usr/bin/man to the name aa-status listed under "complain mode"
```

**✅ Check it worked:** `sudo aa-status` starts with `apparmor module is loaded` and lists profiles `in enforce mode`; `systemctl is-enabled apparmor` prints `enabled`.

---

#### 15.2 Debian AppArmor profiles and status
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 15.2 Debian AppArmor profiles and status**

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
command -v aa-status
sudo aa-status
systemctl status apparmor --no-pager
sudo journalctl -k -n 60 --no-pager | grep -i apparmor
```

If AppArmor or `aa-status` is absent, verify the package, kernel support and README before installation; not every server image includes the full profile set. An enforcing profile can break a required application if misconfigured. Do not disable AppArmor globally to troubleshoot one `DENIED` event; inspect the profile and application path.

**Check/undo:** Test required services after any specific profile edit and restore that profile or mode if needed.

---

### 17. Web browser and applications

#### 17.1 Firefox ESR and browser security
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 17.1 Firefox ESR and browser security**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Turn on Firefox's built-in protections. Images often switch them off.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** Pop-ups, add-on installs and fake websites are how malware gets onto a desktop.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** open Firefox → **≡ → Settings → Privacy & Security**. Labels move between Firefox versions, so if you can't find one, type a word from it (`pop-up`, `add-ons`, `deceptive`, `HTTPS`) into the **Find in Settings** box at the top.
- **Block pop-up windows** ✔
- **Warn you when websites try to install add-ons** ✔
- **Block dangerous and deceptive content** ✔ (and the boxes under it)
- **HTTPS-Only Mode** → on in all windows
- **Passwords:** untick saving passwords unless the README needs it, and check **Saved passwords** for any that shouldn't be there

Then open **≡ → Add-ons and themes → Extensions** and remove any you don't recognise.

**✅ Check it worked:** close and reopen Firefox, then look at the same page again: the boxes are still ticked. If a box is greyed out with "Your browser is being managed by your organization", look at `about:policies` to see which rule sets it.

> [!NOTE]
> Do this in the Firefox of the user you are logged in as. Each user has their own Firefox settings.

---

#### 17.2 Debian Firefox ESR, Thunderbird, desktop software and required applications
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 17.2 Debian Firefox ESR, Thunderbird, desktop software and required applications**

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> dpkg-query -W firefox-esr thunderbird libreoffice-common 2>/dev/null
> apt list --upgradable 2>/dev/null
> apt-cache policy firefox-esr
> ```
>
**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** In GNOME, open **Software** (if installed) for updates. In Firefox ESR, use **Help → About Firefox** to identify release. Match README-required browsers and add-ons rather than assuming every browser or extension is disallowed.

**Fix, only when appropriate:** Update through signed Debian repositories and preserve package holds required by the image. Do not replace ESR with an arbitrary upstream binary or Snap solely because an Ubuntu example recommends it. Confirm required browser functionality and scores afterwards.


<a id="research-report-expansion-d-r5--ssh-rootempty-password-access-validation-and-permitted-logins"></a>
### 🔐 SSH root/empty-password access, validation and permitted logins

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 🔐 SSH root/empty-password access, validation and permitted logins**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Debian vendor-backed. An installed SSH server may be mandatory or disallowed depending on README.

**Check exact effective configuration and overrides:**

~~~bash
dpkg-query -W openssh-server 2>/dev/null
systemctl status ssh --no-pager
sudo grep -RnsE '^[[:space:]]*(Include|Match|PermitRootLogin|PermitEmptyPasswords|PasswordAuthentication|X11Forwarding|MaxAuthTries)' /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d 2>/dev/null
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -t
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -T | grep -Ei '^(permitrootlogin|permitemptypasswords|passwordauthentication|x11forwarding|maxauthtries)'
~~~

**Before fixing:** Retain console or existing admin session, identify approved auth method/SSH port and save the exact file. A generic defensible example when the README permits:

~~~text
PermitRootLogin no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
~~~

These lines belong in the *appropriate* existing sshd config/supported include, not the shell. Avoid duplicate keys and inspect **Match** directives. Disabling X11Forwarding or reducing MaxAuthTries may break assigned tasks—do so only if required.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -t
sudo systemctl reload ssh
~~~

**✅ Verification:** Establish a **second authorized SSH login** using the permitted authentication while keeping the original session open; repeat **sshd -T** with the relevant Match criteria as needed. On a session using socket activation, inspect ssh.socket too.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the specific sshd config from backup, validate it, and reload from console. Do not block the only route to the VM.

<a id="research-report-expansion-d-r6--sensitive-file-modes-suidsgid-and-powerful-groups"></a>
### 🧰 Sensitive file modes, SUID/SGID and powerful groups

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 🧰 Sensitive file modes, SUID/SGID and powerful groups**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Community practice categories; normal SUID files and powerful-group grants can also be legitimate.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
stat -c '%A %a %U:%G %n' /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/shadow /etc/gshadow /etc/sudoers
sudo find /etc -xdev -type f -perm /0002 -ls 2>/dev/null

sudo find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin -xdev -type f \( -perm /4000 -o -perm /2000 \) -ls 2>/dev/null
~~~

**Check privileged groups (each may or may not exist):**

~~~bash
getent group sudo
getent group adm
getent group docker
getent group lxd
getent group libvirt
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why:** World-writable sensitive files and extra SUID bits can allow escalation; membership in docker/lxd/disk/shadow can grant significant access. Investigate service dependencies, owner and package before acting.

**Fix only for an exact confirmed unauthorized grant:**

~~~bash
sudo gpasswd -d EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED_USER docker
~~~

For an identified malicious SUID bit on a specific path, **after recording old mode and owner**, only if the file is confirmed unauthorized:

~~~bash
sudo chmod u-s /path/to/verified-file
~~~

**✅ Verification:** Repeat **id USER**, stat and find on the specific path; test the affected required application. A normal packaged SUID executable (for example passwd) must not be altered blindly.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore only the original verified group membership or permission mode. Do not indiscriminately **chmod -R**, **chown -R** or strip all SUID bits.

### 🔎 Cron, systemd, shell startup and hosts-file persistence

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 🔎 Cron, systemd, shell startup and hosts-file persistence**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Community/training practice; this is not an official disclosure of hidden scoring conditions.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
sudo cat /etc/crontab
sudo ls -la /etc/cron.d /etc/cron.daily /etc/cron.hourly
sudo crontab -l
systemctl list-timers --all
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
sudo ss -lntup
~~~

Inspect exact suspicious jobs, including user-specific crontabs and startup files:

~~~bash
sudo grep -RnsE 'curl|wget|base64|bash -c|/tmp/' /etc/cron.d /etc/profile.d /etc/systemd/system 2>/dev/null
cat /etc/hosts
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpretation:** These text patterns can occur in legitimate backups/update tasks, and **no match does not prove clean**. Review one discovered task/unit with **systemctl cat ACTUAL_UNIT**, owner, executable path, journal messages and package source. Never execute decoded or suspicious scripts to evaluate them.

**Change:** Preserve the exact cron line/service unit and associated forensic answer; if confirmed unauthorized, disable a **single** unit via **sudo systemctl disable --now ACTUAL_UNIT** or comment only the malicious line in the correctly backed-up cron file. For hosts poisoning, edit only the confirmed malicious mapping, preserving README-required internal hostnames.

**✅ Verification:** Repeat cron/systemd/hosts inspection, check **getent hosts ACTUAL_HOSTNAME**, required service tests and the scoring report.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the original single unit enablement/cron line/hosts mapping; do not remove an entire user's crontab or replace /etc/hosts wholesale.

### 🔎 AppArmor, audit logs, required services and score-drop recovery

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 🔎 AppArmor, audit logs, required services and score-drop recovery**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **📚 Evidence:** Community/vendor-supported tooling; actual services and score feedback are scenario-dependent.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
command -v aa-status
sudo aa-status
systemctl status apparmor auditd rsyslog systemd-journald --no-pager
sudo journalctl -p warning -n 40 --no-pager
sudo ss -lntup
~~~

A missing rsyslog, auditd or aa-status tool may reflect the installed image—not automatically an insecure system. Auditing needs storage and configured rules; do not deploy a giant rule set blindly.

**Before stopping a suspect service:** Read README requirements and establish a working application-level check for Apache/Nginx/FTP/Samba/MySQL/PostgreSQL/DNS/DHCP/mail. Save the original unit state/config.

**Fix only for a confirmed unneeded service, substitute actual unit name:**

~~~bash
sudo systemctl disable --now EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED.service
~~~

**✅ Verification:**

~~~bash
systemctl is-enabled EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED.service
systemctl is-active EXAMPLE_UNAUTHORIZED.service
systemctl --failed
~~~

Check required web/database/file sharing/remote login from an approved client. A socket or timer may reactivate a service; investigate activation mechanisms rather than deleting packages automatically.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**

**🔎 Check:** `sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space` prints `= 2`. Also look for files in `/etc/sysctl.d/` that set the opposite (for example `ip_forward=1`): `grep -r . /etc/sysctl.d/`

#### 10.2 Turn off core dumps
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 10.2 Turn off core dumps**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Stop crashing programs from writing a "core dump" (a copy of everything in their memory) to disk.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** A core dump can contain passwords and keys that were in the program's memory. `fs.suid_dumpable = 0` in 10.1 covers programs that run as root; this line covers everyone else.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**
```bash
echo '* hard core 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/security/limits.conf
grep -rs core /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/ | grep -v ':#'   # any other "core" line (e.g. "bob - core unlimited") overrides it: delete it
```

**✅ Check it worked:** `sudo su - bob -c 'ulimit -Hc'` prints `0` (new logins pick it up; your open terminal keeps the old value). Don't check with `sudo -u bob`: `sudo` sets this limit by itself, so it can print `0` even when the setting is wrong.

#### 10.3 Inspect supported sysctl parameters before editing
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 10.3 Inspect supported sysctl parameters before editing**

```bash
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects
sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space
sudo grep -RnsE 'net.ipv4|net.ipv6|kernel.randomize_va_space' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d 2>/dev/null
```

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpret:** Router, VPN, DNS and DHCP images may require forwarding and IPv6. Do not blindly set all examples from a desktop hardening table. Before editing `/etc/sysctl.d/NAME.conf`, inspect overrides and preserve the old value. Apply only a confirmed policy, verify with `sysctl -n key`, and restore if required network functionality breaks. Do not execute `sysctl --system` blindly against an unreviewed collection of config files.

---

### 16. Critical services: complete manual procedures

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Checked every service the README explicitly requires.

**This section contains the actual service procedures directly in this file.** Do not automatically install, remove, disable, restart or lock out a server. Identify its package/unit, preserve the working client operation, save its configuration, make only approved changes, validate syntax, reload if supported, and verify again.

**Shared Debian service inspection:**

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
sudo ss -lntup
sudo journalctl -p err -n 50 --no-pager
```

#### 16.1 General service editing workflow

When the README says a service **must keep working**, you don't remove it. You make it **safer**. This guide covers the services that appear most often on Mint, Debian and Ubuntu images.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rules for every service:
> 1. **Back up the config file first:** `sudo cp file file.bak`
> 2. **Test the config** before restarting (each section shows the test command).
> 3. **Check the service still works** after restarting: `systemctl status <name>`. If it's red or "failed", restore the backup.
> 4. **Check the Scoring Report.** If the score dropped, undo your last change.

Use the per-service manual procedures below for every installed required service. No automation is included in this repository.

---

#### Safe service editing workflow

All commands here are for a **terminal on Ubuntu, Linux Mint or Debian**, using `sudo` for privileged operations. They are written individually so you can inspect the result before the next command. They are not commands to run on this handbook's development workspace. For FreeBSD use its the FreeBSD checklist; packages generally configure under `/usr/local/etc` and use rc services.

Before every service change: read the README, identify its package/unit, record a working client test, preserve evidence, and keep console access. A package can be absent without being a vulnerability. Do not install an unnecessary server just to complete a checklist. Replace all example site, share, user and network names with the image's actual values.

For a config edit, `sudo cp -a` preserves metadata. Use a unique backup suffix if `.before-cp` already exists. In `nano`, **Ctrl+W** searches, **Ctrl+O → Enter** saves, **Ctrl+X** exits. Edit existing directives in their correct section instead of appending contradictory copies. Check included files and per-site overrides. A successful syntax check does not prove client access works.

If a service fails: read `systemctl status` and `journalctl -u UNIT -n 50 --no-pager`, restore the edited file, recheck syntax, then reload/restart. Do not purge and reinstall as a first repair.


#### Apache web server (`apache2`)

| What | Where | Change to |
|---|---|---|
| Hide the version number | `/etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf` | `ServerTokens Prod` and `ServerSignature Off` |
| Disable TRACE requests | same file | `TraceEnable Off` |
| No folder listings | `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` (and site files) | In `Options` lines, remove the word `Indexes` (e.g. `Options FollowSymLinks`) |
| Turn off the listing module | — | Disable `Indexes` in the affected directory; do not force module removal |
| Turn off user home pages | — | `sudo a2dismod userdir` (if enabled) |
| Run as www-data, not root | `/etc/apache2/envvars` | `APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data` and `APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data` |
| Security headers | new file `/etc/apache2/conf-available/security-headers.conf` | see below |

```bash
sudo a2enmod headers
echo '<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
    Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
</IfModule>' | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/security-headers.conf
sudo a2enconf security security-headers
sudo apache2ctl configtest          # must say "Syntax OK"
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

Also check:
- **Web files shouldn't be writable by the web server:** `sudo find /var/www -user www-data -type f`. Usually they should be owned by root: `sudo chown -R root:root /var/www/html` (careful: upload folders for an app like WordPress need write access).
- **Web shells** (hacker control pages hidden in the site): `sudo grep -rlE 'eval\(|base64_decode|shell_exec|system\(\$_' /var/www`
- **`.htaccess` files** that redirect visitors somewhere else: `sudo find /var/www -name .htaccess -exec cat {} \;`

> **💡 Why it matters:** These reduce version disclosure and disable TRACE; they do not replace patching. Check each enabled site for Options Indexes and remove only Indexes if browsing is not required.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Identify the required clients and test one working transaction. Check package and service in a terminal:

```bash
dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Status} ${Version}\n' apache2
systemctl status apache2 --no-pager
systemctl cat apache2
```

`install ok installed` establishes package installation; `active (running)` normally means the daemon is running. Some wrapper/oneshot units show `active (exited)`; inspect the actual daemon too. A missing unit requires checking package documentation, not guessing another service to stop.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** Open the required site in Firefox. There is no standard desktop GUI for Apache configuration; use the editor commands below.

```

Do not replace the whole file with this excerpt. Validate before applying:

```bash
sudo apache2ctl configtest
```

Expected: Syntax OK. If the validation fails, do not continue. When correct:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

A reload generally preserves existing connections; a restart interrupts them. Confirm a service-specific reload is supported before substituting it.

**✅ Check it worked:**

```bash
systemctl status apache2 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u apache2 -n 30 --no-pager
```

Then perform a protocol-level check:

```bash
curl -I http://127.0.0.1/
```

Expected: An expected HTTP status and working required page; a redirect or authenticated response can be legitimate. If the client utility is absent, use an existing authorized client rather than installing a new server. Check firewall source/port allowances as well as local configuration.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore only the files changed in this procedure from the recorded backup:

```bash
sudo cp -a /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf.before-cp /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf
```

Repeat the same validation, apply command and client test. For a directory backup, copying back does not remove newly added files: remove only the specific new file you created after reviewing its contents. Database account/grant changes and web application data require their own backups; configuration restoration does not reverse them.

> [!CAUTION]

> **Warnings and troubleshooting:** Inspect the first error in the unit journal. Check permissions, included configuration, address conflicts and required credentials. Never disable the firewall, drop a database, remove all shares or reinstall the service to hide one error.

#### Nginx web server

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
In the `http { ... }` block: `server_tokens off;`

In the site files (`/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*`): change `autoindex on;` to `autoindex off;`, and optionally add:
```
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
```
```bash
sudo nginx -t                       # must say "test is successful"

#### PHP (used by the website)

Edit the **web** PHP settings, not the command-line ones: `/etc/php/<version>/apache2/php.ini` (Apache) or `/etc/php/<version>/fpm/php.ini` (Nginx).

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `expose_php` | `Off` | Hide the PHP version |
| `display_errors` | `Off` | Don't show error details to visitors |
| `log_errors` | `On` | …but do log them |
| `allow_url_fopen` | `Off` | Restricts URL-aware file functions; can break legitimate HTTP integrations |
| `allow_url_include` | `Off` | Pages can't include remote code |
| `disable_functions` | `exec,passthru,shell_exec,system,proc_open,popen` | Reduces some command-execution paths; not a sandbox |
| `session.cookie_httponly` | `1` | JavaScript can't steal login cookies |
| `session.use_strict_mode` | `1` | Rejects made-up session IDs |

Then `sudo systemctl reload apache2` (or `php8.1-fpm` etc.).

> [!WARNING]
> `disable_functions` can break some web apps. If the site stops working after the change, remove functions from the list one at a time.

#### MySQL / MariaDB

##### Built-in hardening tool
```bash

```
Answer **yes** to: remove anonymous users, disallow root login remotely, remove the test database, reload privileges.

##### Settings file
`/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` (MySQL) or `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf` (MariaDB), under `[mysqld]`:
```
bind-address = 127.0.0.1      # only this computer can connect (skip if the README says others connect)
local_infile = 0              # SQL can't read files from the server's disk
```

sudo systemctl restart mysql      # or mariadb
```

##### Look at the database users
```bash
sudo mysql
```
```sql
SELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user;          -- every database account
-- Only after recording SHOW CREATE USER and SHOW GRANTS for the exact account:
DROP USER ''@'localhost';                            -- an anonymous account
DROP USER 'root'@'%';                                -- root allowed from anywhere
-- Change an application credential only together with its private application configuration; never reuse a handbook example password.
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'webapp'@'localhost';                -- what this account can do
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```
Accounts that aren't needed, or that have `ALL PRIVILEGES` without needing them, are common planted problems.

Do not replace the whole file with this excerpt. Validate before applying:

```bash
sudo grep -nE "anonymous_enable|anon_upload_enable|chroot|ssl_enable|rsa_cert|pasv_" /etc/vsftpd.conf
```

Expected: Review each setting manually; vsftpd has no portable standalone syntax-test flag. If the validation fails, do not continue. When correct:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart vsftpd
```

A reload generally preserves existing connections; a restart interrupts them. Confirm a service-specific reload is supported before substituting it.

**✅ Check it worked:**

```bash
systemctl status vsftpd --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u vsftpd -n 30 --no-pager
```

Then perform a protocol-level check:

```bash
sudo ss -ltnp | grep ":21 "
```

Expected: An FTP listener on the intended address; then log in and transfer an allowed test file with the required client. Port 21 alone does not verify passive data transfers. If the client utility is absent, use an existing authorized client rather than installing a new server. Check firewall source/port allowances as well as local configuration.

```

Repeat the same validation, apply command and client test. For a directory backup, copying back does not remove newly added files: remove only the specific new file you created after reviewing its contents. Database account/grant changes and web application data require their own backups; configuration restoration does not reverse them.

#### ProFTPD
In `/etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf`: `DefaultRoot ~`, `RootLogin off`, `ServerIdent off`, and comment out (`#`) the whole `<Anonymous ~ftp> ... </Anonymous>` block. Test with `sudo proftpd -t`.

#### PostgreSQL: local and required remote database access

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — PostgreSQL: local and required remote database access**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Inspect PostgreSQL listening addresses, client authentication and database roles.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** `trust` authentication can let a connecting client impersonate database users without a password. An overly restrictive listener can break a required web application on another machine.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** In a Linux terminal run:

```bash
dpkg-query -W postgresql postgresql-common
pg_lsclusters
```

`pg_lsclusters` lists version, cluster, port, status and data/log directories. The generic `postgresql.service` can be `active (exited)` while a cluster is down; inspect the listed cluster. Connect locally:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'SHOW config_file;' -c 'SHOW hba_file;' -c 'SHOW listen_addresses;'
```

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** Use a trusted installed database client to test the authorized account; do not use a superuser's successful connection as the ordinary client's test. There is no standard desktop GUI for these configuration files.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.

Inspect `listen_addresses = 'localhost'` for local-only clients. Required remote clients need the intended server address, not a blind wildcard. Then:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf
```

Keep legitimate local peer authentication. Replace only an unauthorized `trust` rule with a compatible method. An example restricted remote rule is configuration text:

```text
host    appdb    appuser    192.168.10.0/24    scram-sha-256
```

First ensure that the role has a SCRAM password and clients support it. PostgreSQL uses the **first matching** HBA rule; a later secure rule does not override an earlier broad one.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.

> sudo -u postgres psql -c 'SELECT sourcefile,sourceline,name,error FROM pg_file_settings WHERE error IS NOT NULL;'
> ```
>
No error rows is expected, but these views do not replace client tests. Reload HBA-only changes:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -c 'SELECT pg_reload_conf();'
```

Listener changes require a scheduled cluster restart, for this example:

```bash
sudo pg_ctlcluster 15 main restart
```

**✅ Check it worked:** Run `pg_lsclusters`, re-query settings and test the real application as its database role. In `psql`, `\du` lists roles; inspect unexpected superuser, create-role or replication privileges. Do not put passwords on the shell command line.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the two original files, validate them again, reload or restart according to which setting changed, and repeat the client test. Restore role credentials/grants separately if they changed.

For installed Kea instead, back up its JSON file, edit the existing `Dhcp4` → `subnet4`, `pools`, `option-data` and `interfaces-config` settings; preserve JSON types and validate:

```bash
sudo kea-dhcp4 -t /etc/kea/kea-dhcp4.conf
```

Then restart `kea-dhcp4-server` only after success. Do not apply ISC syntax to Kea.

#### 16.2 Debian-specific installed service packages and access verification

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Confirmed installed daemon names and actual sockets.

| Service | Typical Debian package/unit | Debian configuration and test |
|---|---|---|
| Apache | `apache2` | `/etc/apache2/`; `apache2ctl configtest` |
| Nginx | `nginx` | `/etc/nginx/`; `nginx -t` |
| PHP-FPM | `php*-fpm` | `/etc/php/VERSION/fpm/`; discover actual version/unit |
| MariaDB | `mariadb-server` / `mariadb` | `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/`; test local application SQL |
| PostgreSQL | `postgresql` / versioned cluster | `pg_lsclusters`; `pg_hba.conf` and required connections |
| vsftpd | `vsftpd` | `/etc/vsftpd.conf`; authorized FTP/TLS client transaction |
| Samba | `samba`, `smbd` | `/etc/samba/smb.conf`; `testparm -s` |
| BIND DNS | `bind9` / `named` | `named-checkconf` and DNS queries |
| Postfix | `postfix` | `postfix check`; authorized mail flow |
| DHCP | `isc-dhcp-server` or `kea-*` | detect actual implementation, test client lease |
| SSH | `openssh-server` / `ssh` | `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`; `sshd -t` |

**Commands to identify installed packages:**

```bash
dpkg-query -W apache2 nginx mariadb-server postgresql samba bind9 postfix openssh-server vsftpd 2>/dev/null
sudo ss -lntup
```

**Important:** Database/FTP/web app configuration can be **stateful**, not just a text file. Back up application data and grants using an appropriate supported method before a destructive change. A config-file copy cannot undo a database schema migration or user deletion.

### 18. Advanced manual verification and recovery

These procedures supplement every earlier checklist table. Ubuntu and Debian use the same underlying APT/systemd tools where stated; their own checklists describe differences. Open **Menu → Terminal** or press **Ctrl+Alt+T**. Configuration blocks marked `text` are file contents, not commands. Examples use `bob`; substitute the README's actual account. Do not paste placeholders such as `<PID>` literally.

#### 18.1 Users, root and privilege recovery

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 18.1 Users, root and privilege recovery**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Reconcile people, service identities and powerful groups without losing administrator access.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** A low UID or an unfamiliar name is not proof of an attacker. Locking a password does not revoke SSH keys, an existing session or a sudo grant.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Record authorized users and service dependencies. Keep a working root terminal open while testing authentication. Protect backups:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 700 /root/cp-backups
sudo cp -a /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/shadow /etc/gshadow /root/cp-backups/
```

Never copy shadow files to a world-readable desktop directory. Account files form a related database; blindly restoring an old copy can conflict with users created by later package installations.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** **Menu → Administration → Users and Groups**; select each person, inspect account type and group membership, compare with the README. Do not delete a home directory while forensics remains unresolved. GUI absence means use the terminal; do not install another desktop.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.

> sudo awk -F: '$3 == 0 { print $1, $3, $6, $7 }' /etc/passwd
> ```
>
`sudo -v` validates the current user's sudo access. Normally only root has UID 0, but investigate any exception before editing. `getent` can include directory-service accounts that are not in local files. Inspect an account:

```bash
id bob
sudo passwd -S bob
sudo chage -l bob
sudo -l -U bob
```

`P` means a usable password hash, `L` a locked password, `NP` no password. None proves the password is strong. `sudo -l -U` lists policy, including grants outside the sudo group.

Remove one unauthorized membership:

```bash
sudo gpasswd -d bob sudo
```

For a confirmed unauthorized account, after evidence collection use account expiration for reversible denial of normal new logins:

```bash
sudo usermod --expiredate 1970-01-02 mallory
```

Investigate existing sessions, processes, keys and services separately. If deletion is explicitly required, preserve its UID, groups and home first, then use `sudo userdel mallory` without `-r`; delete the preserved data only after evidence review and authorization.

**✅ Check it worked:** Log into a **new** permitted session as the authorized user and run `id` and `sudo -l`. Group changes do not alter existing sessions. Check an expired account with `sudo chage -l mallory`.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Re-add a removed group with `sudo usermod -aG sudo bob` only if it was originally authorized. Restore the recorded account expiry with `sudo chage -E YYYY-MM-DD mallory`, or `sudo chage -E -1 mallory` only if it originally had no expiration. Do not unlock an account that was originally locked. Account deletion cannot be undone just by recreating a name.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Never use `usermod -G sudo` without `-a` to add membership; it replaces supplementary groups. Do not lock root on Debian until a separate administrator and recovery path work. Service identities such as postgres may legitimately use a shell for maintenance.

#### 18.2 Password aging, PAM and lockout without breaking login

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 18.2 Password aging, PAM and lockout without breaking login**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Set password policy and validate the actual PAM stack used for login/password changes.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** Incorrect PAM ordering can allow weak passwords or deny every login. `/etc/login.defs` defaults do not change existing users. `pam_tally`/`pam_tally2` examples from older scripts are obsolete on modern releases.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Keep a root console open and back up all affected files:

```bash
sudo cp -a /etc/pam.d /root/cp-backups/pam.d.before-policy
sudo cp -a /etc/security /root/cp-backups/security.before-policy
sudo cp -a /etc/login.defs /root/cp-backups/login.defs.before-policy
```

Use unique backup names if repeating. Record `sudo chage -l bob` before modifying that user.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** Use **Users and Groups** to change only approved user passwords. Standard desktop settings do not expose the complete PAM stack or aging policy; use the terminal for those.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> grep -nE 'pam_unix|pam_pwquality|pam_pwhistory|pam_faillock|nullok' /etc/pam.d/common-auth /etc/pam.d/common-account /etc/pam.d/common-password
> ls /usr/share/pam-configs
> find /usr/lib -name pam_faillock.so -o -name pam_pwhistory.so -o -name pam_pwquality.so 2>/dev/null
> ```
>
Do not insert a module that is absent. Read the installed `man pam_pwquality`, `man pam_pwhistory`, `man pam_faillock` and `man pam-auth-update`; capabilities vary with release and package version.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.

This means maximum age 90 days, minimum age 1 day, warning 14 days. Use scenario values rather than blindly applying these to service accounts. Inspect/edit defaults for future accounts:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
```

For complexity, install only the applicable policy package if absent and permitted:

```bash
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
```

Use its supplied profile through `sudo pam-auth-update`, selecting password quality without deselecting the required Unix authentication profile. Edit `/etc/security/pwquality.conf` using the settings in section 3.3. A root user can bypass quality unless enforcement is configured; test as an ordinary user.

For history, prefer `pam_pwhistory` when supported. Inspect the existing common-password sequence: quality must obtain the new token, history must check it, and pam_unix must consume it via `use_authtok`. A typical history module line is:

```text
password required pam_pwhistory.so remember=5 use_authtok
```

This is **not** a complete PAM stack. Place it after the active quality module and before the password-writing module, accounting for numeric jump controls already present. Do not append a module after `pam_deny` and assume it executes. Do not duplicate `remember` mechanisms.

For supported faillock, `/etc/security/faillock.conf` can specify:

```text
deny = 5
fail_interval = 900
unlock_time = 900
```

These values alone do not enable lockout: the distribution's PAM stack needs correctly ordered preauth/authfail/account integration. Prefer a supplied distribution profile if present. If none exists, do not paste a generic replacement stack; review the installed module's example and existing control flow with a mentor before changing authentication. Do not lock root or your only administrator to test it.

**✅ Check it worked:** Keep the root console open. From a **separate ordinary user session**, run `passwd` and confirm a deliberately weak test password is rejected before choosing a unique strong one. A root `su - bob` can bypass the password and is not proof authentication works. Test a normal new login and sudo. Inspect errors:

```bash
sudo journalctl _COMM=sudo -n 30 --no-pager
sudo chage -l bob
sudo faillock --user bob
```

Use `faillock` only if installed/configured. An empty record can mean no failures, not successful integration.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** From the root console, restore the specific modified PAM/config files from backup (preserving metadata), then test a separate login again before exiting root. To clear a mistakenly locked test account's faillock counter:

```bash
sudo faillock --user bob --reset
```

Restore the user's recorded `chage` values individually. A password reset is not reversible to the unknown old plaintext password.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Never expose hashes, use one shared password, or test repeated failed logins against the active administrator. Do not restart the desktop display manager while unsaved work is open.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Record the required port, authentication methods, source networks and any SFTP/forwarding requirements. Keep your existing remote connection and console open.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** Use the VM console for recovery. A desktop's sharing panel may configure remote desktop rather than OpenSSH; do not treat them as the same service.

> sudo ss -ltnp
> ```
>
`sshd -T` parses effective defaults. Match-dependent rules need a connection-specific inspection, using real values:

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -T -C user=bob,host=client.example,addr=192.168.10.20
```

> ```bash
> sudo cp -a /etc/ssh /root/cp-backups/ssh.before-cp
> sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
> ```
>
Inspect section 9's table and actual included files. Set `PermitRootLogin no` and `PermitEmptyPasswords no` if compatible with the scenario; retain a tested authentication method for each required user. A first parsed value generally wins for a given context; inspect where Include appears rather than assuming all drop-ins always override all main-file lines. `ClientAliveInterval`/`ClientAliveCountMax` detect unresponsive clients; a responsive idle client can stay connected.

Validate:

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -t
```

No output and exit 0 is expected. Then, for ordinary config changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload ssh.service
```

For socket-managed port/listen changes follow the Ubuntu-specific procedure; a daemon reload alone might not change the listening socket.

**✅ Check it worked:** In a second terminal on an authorized client, use `ssh bob@server-name` with the actual hostname and port. Confirm login and the required sudo/SFTP function, then repeat `sshd -T`, `ss -ltnp` and the journal check. Close the old connection only after success.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the particular edited SSH config/drop-in from `/root/cp-backups/ssh.before-cp`, remove only newly created drop-ins, run `sshd -t`, and reload/restart the appropriate unit from the console. Restore firewall port/source changes too.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Do not delete all authorized_keys files. Inspect fingerprints with `ssh-keygen -lf FILE` and remove only confirmed unauthorized keys after preserving them privately. A root key may be legitimate recovery access.

#### 18.4 UFW and nftables: one firewall owner

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**

> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Use the console. Record actual server ports, UDP services, IPv6 use and source networks. Do not change `/etc/ufw/before.rules` to copy legacy anti-spoofing snippets without understanding existing defaults.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** If installed, **Menu → Firewall Configuration** (GUFW) → unlock → inspect profiles and existing rules. Create the required allow rule before switching the firewall on. GUFW configures UFW; it is not a separate firewall engine.

Inactive UFW does not prove no firewall exists. Save native nftables rules if that is the owner's tool:

```bash
sudo nft list ruleset | sudo tee /root/cp-backups/nft-before.nft > /dev/null
```

> [!NOTE]

>
Then:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw enable
```

Use actual required ports. FTP may need passive data ports, DNS both TCP/UDP 53, DHCP its interface-specific UDP path. Do not guess these from the process name.

If the image already uses native nftables, preserve that policy and edit `/etc/nftables.conf` instead of enabling UFW. Back it up first. In the **existing** input base chain, preserve loopback, established/related traffic and required ICMP/ICMPv6, add source-scoped service rules before any matching drop, then validate:

```bash
sudo nft -c -f /etc/nftables.conf
```

Only after reviewing the entire ruleset from the console:

```bash
sudo nft -f /etc/nftables.conf
```

Do not paste a second generic input chain. Stateful IPv6 operation needs ICMPv6 neighbor discovery; blanket blocking it breaks networking.

**✅ Check it worked:** Query the owner's rules and test a fresh permitted connection from another machine. Verify required remote services and IPv4/IPv6 as applicable, not merely `ping` or an old established SSH session.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** For a newly created UFW rule use `sudo ufw status numbered`, identify its exact number and `sudo ufw delete NUMBER` (replace NUMBER). Restore recorded defaults only if changed. For native nftables restore the reviewed full policy from the console; understand whether the file flushes existing tables before loading. Do not run `nft flush ruleset` remotely as a shortcut.

> [!CAUTION]

Use the GUI or `sudo nano` on that specific file. Preserve the matching Debian and Ubuntu base suites; Linux Debian Debian Edition follows Debian instead. Then:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Stop on signature, release or 404 errors and investigate the specific source. After success preview the proposed upgrade:

```bash
apt -s upgrade
```

Review changes, then:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

Do not blindly purge held packages or run autoremove. Preview any targeted removal with `apt -s remove PACKAGE` using the actual name; preserve required dependencies and desktop metapackages.

**✅ Check it worked:** `apt list --upgradable` reports remaining upgrades; some may be phased, held or require a reviewed dependency transition. Run `sudo dpkg --audit` for incomplete package configuration and open required applications after updating. There is no universal APT command that proves every installed package has no vulnerability; consult distribution security advisories for the exact installed release/version.

Debian/Ubuntu/Debian commonly use root:shadow mode 640 for `/etc/shadow`; compare the distribution's baseline rather than applying it on FreeBSD. World-writable temporary directories often legitimately use sticky mode 1777. Check package ownership and modifications:

```bash
dpkg-query -S /usr/bin/passwd
sudo dpkg -V passwd
```

Verification output is a lead; local configuration can legitimately differ, and package metadata on a compromised machine is not an independent trusted baseline.

#### 18.7 Cron, systemd and malicious persistence

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 18.7 Cron, systemd and malicious persistence**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Review scheduled and boot/login execution paths.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** Legitimate backup, update and service tasks also run as root. Deleting all cron jobs destroys required operations and evidence.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Record command, user, schedule, file path and package owner. Keep copies in `/root/cp-backups`, outside executable startup locations.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** Debian **Menu → Preferences → Startup Applications**; inspect each entry and disable only an unauthorized one. This does not cover systemd, root cron or every user's desktop startup.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.

>
“No crontab” is not an error requiring a new job. Inspect a suspicious system unit:

```bash
systemctl cat example.service
systemctl show example.service -p FragmentPath -p DropInPaths -p User -p ExecStart
```

Also inspect `/etc/rc.local`, `/etc/profile.d`, `/etc/ld.so.preload`, `/etc/systemd/system`, user shell profiles and `~/.config/autostart`. Do not run referenced suspicious scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> sudo crontab -u bob -l | sudo tee /root/cp-backups/bob-crontab.before-cp > /dev/null
> ```
>
Only use the backup if the listing succeeded. Edit that user's crontab with `sudo crontab -u bob -e`, removing just the unauthorized line. For a confirmed unauthorized unit:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now example.timer
sudo systemctl disable --now example.service
```

Inspect any socket/path activation too; disabling one unit may not prevent another from starting it. Do not disable real system units named by the README.

**✅ Check it worked:** Re-list the crontab, unit state and timers, inspect the process/listener and test required scheduled jobs. `systemctl daemon-reload` is needed after unit-file changes, but is not itself a service restart.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Reinstall a valid saved crontab with `sudo crontab -u bob /root/cp-backups/bob-crontab.before-cp`. Restore the recorded enabled/running states individually; do not enable every unit you inspected. A copied startup file must return to its original owner and mode.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Do not `crontab -r`, blanket-remove `.desktop` files, or restrict all cron access to root unless the scenario actually requires it. User timers run in the user's manager; root's `systemctl --user` is not the desktop user's manager.

#### 18.8 Kernel, AppArmor and logging

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 18.8 Kernel, AppArmor and logging**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Apply supported kernel controls, keep mandatory-access controls active and preserve investigation logs.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** Linux kernel settings differ from FreeBSD, and routers/VPNs/containers may require forwarding. AppArmor denials can explain an otherwise confusing service failure.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Record current values and inspect existing drop-ins. Do not disable AppArmor or forwarding without checking the role.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** System Monitor can show processes/resources; use **Logs** if installed for system errors. Kernel and AppArmor policy normally require terminal inspection.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies kernel.randomize_va_space
> sudo grep -RHE 'ip_forward|accept_redirects|randomize_va_space' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d 2>/dev/null
> sudo aa-status
> sudo journalctl -k -g 'apparmor="DENIED"' --no-pager
> sudo journalctl --since '1 hour ago' -p warning --no-pager
> ```
>
No `aa-status` command means inspect whether apparmor utilities are installed before assuming the security mechanism is absent. Do not replace a working LSM configuration blindly.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> sudo nano /etc/sysctl.d/60-cp-local.conf
> ```
>
Example supported workstation settings (file contents):

```text
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
```

Syncookies help during a TCP SYN backlog overflow; ASLR makes memory layout less predictable. They are not a firewall or malware detector. Do not add unknown keys or disable IPv6 globally. Apply just this file:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/60-cp-local.conf
```

If a required service is denied by AppArmor, inspect the named profile and denied operation, confirm the operation is legitimate, and update only the relevant local profile rule using distribution guidance. Do not put every profile in complain mode.

**✅ Check it worked:** Query the two sysctl values again, test the required service and review fresh kernel denials. Check `systemctl status systemd-journald`; rsyslog/auth.log may not be installed on every Debian-based image. `journalctl --list-boots` shows retained boots, not a guarantee all historical logs were preserved.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the old drop-in or remove only your newly created file, then explicitly restore the recorded runtime values using `sudo sysctl -w KEY=OLDVALUE` with real values. Removing a file alone does not undo its live settings. Restore only the changed AppArmor rule and reload its individual profile after validation.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** Do not clear journals, truncate logs, or install a logging daemon merely to force one filename to exist. Log output can contain personal data and secrets; keep it private.

#### 18.9 Service and desktop completion checks

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — 18.9 Service and desktop completion checks**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Verify required services, desktop login and ordinary-user workflows after hardening.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** A daemon can be running while its application is unreachable, its database is down or its permissions deny required users.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Note the original display manager with `systemctl status display-manager`; Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce and GNOME use different settings schemas.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** In the logged-in user's **Screensaver / Privacy → Screen Lock**, set an appropriate timeout and require a password. In login settings disable unauthorized autologin. In the browser review extensions, protection settings and **Help → About** updates. Test locking and unlocking before logging out.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> gsettings list-schemas | grep -E 'cinnamon|gnome.desktop.screensaver|gnome.desktop.session'
> ```
>
Use only the schema that exists. Record `gsettings get SCHEMA KEY` before each earlier desktop change; the exact schema/key in section 8 applies to Cinnamon, not every Debian flavor. For system health:

```bash
systemctl --failed
ip -br address
ip route
sudo ss -tulpn
```

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
**✅ Check it worked:** New authorized login, screen lock/unlock, sudo, hostname resolution, required web/database/share/SSH transactions, all saved forensic answers, current score timestamp, no new service failures. Check package operations have completed before any necessary reboot.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:** Restore the recorded desktop key with `gsettings set` or its GUI value. Restore the exact display-manager config from backup if login fails, using console access. Do not restart the display manager to test while unsaved work remains.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **⚠️ Warnings:** A reboot can lose unsaved work and remote access. Finish updates and preserve recovery access first; the rules and actual update state determine whether/when to reboot.

#### 18.10 Supplementary investigations: sudo, SSH, PAM, UFW, cron, service persistence and package checks

The following procedure references are included for completeness, with Debian root-console and service-required exceptions overriding generic Ubuntu/Mint assumptions.


> Use alongside Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Debian, and critical service hardening. This page assumes **Ubuntu / Debian / Linux Mint using systemd**; consult the FreeBSD checklist for FreeBSD-specific commands. **Read the image README and preserve forensics evidence first.**

These are individually copyable terminal commands. **Inspection is not the same as permission to modify.** Run modifications only after verifying accounts, critical services, connectivity and backups.

#### 18.L1. Verify user identities and sudo privileges—don't guess from names

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Matched every privileged identity to the competition README.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
getent passwd
~~~

The third colon-delimited field is the UID, and the final field is the login shell. Service accounts commonly use \`/usr/sbin/nologin\`; that is not automatically suspicious.

~~~bash
awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1 " UID=" $3 " home=" $6 " shell=" $7}' /etc/passwd
~~~

Only \`root\` normally needs UID 0. An additional UID 0 account requires investigation, but **do not delete it before the README check and forensic preservation**.

~~~bash
getent group sudo
sudo grep -RnsE '^[[:space:]]*[^#[:space:]].*(ALL|NOPASSWD)' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d 2>/dev/null
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpretation:** Sudo rules can grant rights to users/groups without those names appearing as members of the \`sudo\` group. Look for \`NOPASSWD\`, wildcards and unusual command allowlists, but understand service/administration needs before editing.

**Before editing a sudo rule:**

~~~bash
sudo visudo -c
sudo cp -a /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.cp-backup
~~~

If authorized, use \`sudo visudo\` for the main file or \`sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/NAME\` for a specific included file. **Never edit sudo policy with an unvalidated plain-text overwrite.**

**Check after an authorized edit:**

~~~bash
sudo visudo -c
~~~

**Recovery:** Restore the backed-up single file through a root/recovery console if sudo stops working. Test a separate authorized session before leaving the administrator session.

#### 18.L2. SSH: inspect *effective* settings and socket activation

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Confirmed whether SSH is required, listening and correctly configured.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ~~~bash
> systemctl status ssh --no-pager
> systemctl status ssh.socket --no-pager
> sudo ss -lntp
> ~~~
>
A distribution may use \`ssh.service\`, \`ssh.socket\` or other units; an inactive service does **not** alone mean that clients cannot connect. Ubuntu releases since 22.10 may use socket activation, with a generator-based configuration behavior on Ubuntu 24.04.

**Find the effective configuration, including snippets:**

~~~bash
sudo grep -RnsE '^[[:space:]]*(Include|PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|KbdInteractiveAuthentication|AllowUsers|AllowGroups|PubkeyAuthentication|Port|ListenAddress)' /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d 2>/dev/null
~~~

~~~bash
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -t
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -T | grep -Ei '^(port|permitrootlogin|passwordauthentication|pubkeyauthentication|kbdinteractiveauthentication|allowusers|allowgroups) '
~~~

\`sshd -t\` checks configuration syntax. \`sshd -T\` prints effective settings for a generic connection; **\`Match\` rules may alter settings for particular users/hosts**, so check their applicability before concluding all sessions have the same policy.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** In a terminal use \`sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\` or edit the *specific* applicable file under \`/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/\`. Before modifying it, copy that same file with \`sudo cp -a source destination\` to a backup path.

**Safe sequence for an authorized change:**

1. Keep the existing administrative session open.
2. Record current listening port, login method and allowed source addresses.
3. Confirm the README-required SSH accounts and methods; do **not** blindly disable password authentication if no working keys exist.
4. Edit the specific applicable setting, avoiding conflicting \`Include\` or \`Match\` directives.
5. Run \`sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -t\`; **stop if it reports errors**.
6. Reload the relevant service if supported and consistent with socket activation. On a conventional systemd SSH service:

~~~bash
sudo systemctl reload ssh
~~~

7. Open **a second SSH session** from an approved client, test normal login, and only then close the original session.

**Recovery:** Restore the exact backed-up config and reload/activate the appropriate unit using VM console if the remote test fails. If you changed the listening port on a socket-activated release, verify the socket generator/unit state too; don't assume an \`sshd_config\` reload alone changes the listener.

#### 18.L3. PAM policy: inspect order before adding modules

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Inspected current PAM stack and package availability.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
dpkg-query -W libpam-pwquality libpam-modules libpam-runtime 2>/dev/null
sudo grep -nEv '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' /etc/pam.d/common-password /etc/pam.d/common-auth
grep -E '^[[:space:]]*PASS_(MAX|MIN|WARN)' /etc/login.defs
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpretation:** PAM is order-sensitive. A duplicated \`pam_unix.so\`, unsuitable control flag, or unavailable module can lock out every user. \`/etc/login.defs\` supplies defaults for some tools; it does **not** automatically change every existing account's expiry settings.

**Read one existing user's actual policy (replace username):**

~~~bash
sudo chage -l exampleuser
~~~

If changing aging is required, consult the policy specified in the README and the Mint checklist for \`chage\` examples.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before edits:** Preserve backups of \`/etc/pam.d/common-password\`, \`common-auth\` and the relevant original config, plus working console/root access. When available, use distribution-maintained \`pam-auth-update\` rather than inventing a new stack.

**✅ Verification:** Before logging out, test authentication in a *new local or console session* as an authorized ordinary user and verify an authorized sudo elevation. Never intentionally force a logout while authentication is unverified.

**Recovery:** Restore the specific original PAM file using recovery/console access, then retest. This is a high-risk category and should not be changed merely because a generic checklist recommends a number.

#### 18.L4. Check scheduled persistence in cron and systemd

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Investigated scheduler entries before deleting anything.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
sudo cat /etc/crontab
sudo ls -la /etc/cron.d /etc/cron.daily /etc/cron.hourly /etc/cron.weekly /etc/cron.monthly
sudo crontab -l
~~~

The last command shows root's crontab because of \`sudo\`. To inspect one authorized user's crontab:

~~~bash
sudo crontab -u exampleuser -l
~~~

**Inspect enabled and currently active units:**

~~~bash
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
systemctl list-timers --all
systemctl --failed
~~~

**Inspect where a particular unit comes from (replace the name):**

~~~bash
systemctl cat example.service
systemctl show example.service -p FragmentPath -p ExecStart -p User -p WantedBy
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **What to look for:** Unexpected execution from writable directories, shell commands launched as root, timers with misleading names, recent unexplained unit changes. A valid systemd service may be intentionally started through sockets or dependencies even when its service unit is disabled.

**✅ Verification:** Correlate any suspicious entry with \`journalctl -u example.service\`, ownership, file hashes, the README, and required software. Do not execute suspicious payloads.

**Recovery:** For an unauthorized entry, document and preserve it before making the smallest authorized change. To undo a previous disable operation, restore the recorded original unit enablement/state only; do not indiscriminately enable every listed service.

#### 18.L5. Firewall: preserve required access before enabling UFW

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Identified real listeners, rule owner and permitted clients.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

~~~bash
sudo ss -lntup
sudo ufw status verbose
sudo ufw status numbered
~~~

On hosts using \`nftables\` directly, inspect **before** adding UFW rules:

~~~bash
sudo nft list ruleset
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpretation:** A service on \`127.0.0.1\` is locally bound, while \`0.0.0.0\` or \`[::]\` may be externally reachable if network/firewall paths allow. A listening port is not automatically unnecessary.

**Before an approved UFW enablement:** Write down required SSH, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, DHCP and other ports from the README; check the current remote-management path.

For an image requiring SSH on TCP 22, the specific allowance is:

~~~bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
~~~

Only after verifying the required rules and retaining console access, if UFW is the chosen firewall:

~~~bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
~~~

**✅ Verify:** From an approved client, retest every README-required service and the management connection. \`ufw\` is a front end to Linux packet filtering and may coexist/conflict with other managers; do **not** reset \`iptables\`/\`nftables\` blindly.

**Recovery:** If you blocked access, use the VM console to restore the documented previous UFW state/rules; avoid deleting all firewall rules as a first response.

#### 18.L6. Narrow file and package investigations

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Inspected evidence, not deleted files by extension alone.

~~~bash
sudo find /home /root /tmp /var/tmp -type f -mtime -2 -printf '%TY-%Tm-%Td %TH:%TM %u %m %p\n' 2>/dev/null
sudo find /home /root /tmp /var/tmp -type f -perm /0002 -ls 2>/dev/null
sudo find /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
~~~

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🧠 Interpretation:** These are *scoped searches*. They do not prove the rest of the file system is clean. World-writable and SUID files can be legitimate; an unusual entry requires review of owner, package and use.

~~~bash
dpkg -S /usr/bin/ssh 2>/dev/null
apt-cache policy openssh-server
grep -h ' install ' /var/log/dpkg.log* 2>/dev/null | tail -30
~~~

If \`dpkg -S\` reports no owning package for another path, investigate—some applications are legitimately installed outside dpkg.

**Final check:**

~~~bash
systemctl --failed
sudo ss -lntup
who
~~~

Confirm normal login, sudo, DNS/networking and all required services. Record any unverified concern rather than destroy unknown files.

### 20. Complete Linux terminal basics (embedded)

The original practical text and copyable command blocks are retained here for self-contained study. For a Debian image, use Debian-specific explanations in Sections 0–19 before changing a setting.


The **terminal** is a window where you type commands instead of clicking. On Linux most security work is faster in the terminal, and many settings can *only* be changed there.

**Open it:** press **Ctrl + Alt + T**, or open the menu and search for "Terminal".

##### How a command looks

```bash
id bob
```
- `id` = the command (show identity and group membership).
- `sudo` before a privileged command means run it with administrative authority; it normally asks for **your** password and does not echo it. This read-only example does not need it.
- `bob` = what to do it to.

Press **Enter** to run it. If it worked, Linux often prints **nothing**. Check the exit status and repeat the native verification; silence alone is not proof of success.

##### Keys that save time
| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Tab** | Auto-complete a file or command name. Press it twice to see the choices. |
| **↑ / ↓** | Bring back earlier commands. |
| **Ctrl + C** | Stop the command that is running. |
| **Ctrl + Shift + C / V** | Copy / paste *inside the terminal* (plain Ctrl+C means "stop"!). |
| **q** | Quit a viewer like `less` or `man`. |

##### The 20 commands you'll actually use
| Command | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `pwd` | Show which folder you're in | `pwd` |
| `ls -la` | List files, including hidden ones (names starting with `.`) | `ls -la /home/bob` |
| `cd` | Go to a folder | `cd /etc` |
| `cat` | Print a file | `cat /etc/passwd` |
| `less` | Read a long file (q to quit, / to search) | `less /var/log/auth.log` |
| `nano` | Simple text editor (Ctrl+O save, Ctrl+X exit) | `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` |
| `grep` | Find lines containing a word | `grep -i bob /etc/group` |
| `find` | Find files | `sudo find /home -iname "*.mp3"` |
| `rm` | Delete a file (no recycle bin!) | `sudo rm /home/bob/song.mp3` |
| `cp` | Copy | `sudo cp file file.bak` |
| `sudo` | Run as administrator | `sudo apt update` |
| `apt` | Install / remove / update software | `sudo apt purge nmap` |
| `systemctl` | Start / stop / check services | `systemctl status ssh` |
| `ss -tulpn` | Show what's listening on the network | `sudo ss -tulpn` |
| `ps aux` | Show running programs | `ps aux \| grep nc` |
| `id` | Show a user's groups | `id bob` |
| `passwd` | Change a password | `sudo passwd bob` |
| `chmod` / `chown` | Change permissions / owner | `sudo chmod 640 /etc/shadow` |
| `history` | Show your past commands | `history` |
| `man` | The manual for a command | `man userdel` |

##### Reading permissions
```
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1234 Oct 22 10:00 /etc/shadow
 ^^^ owner can read+write
    ^^^ group can read
       ^^^ others: nothing
```
Numbers: r=4, w=2, x=1. So `640` = owner rw (6), group r (4), others none (0).

##### Paths you'll see a lot
| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `/etc/` | Settings files for almost everything |
| `/home/<user>/` | Each user's files (Desktop, Documents, Downloads...) |
| `/var/log/` | Log files |
| `/tmp/` | Temporary files (attackers like hiding things here) |
| `/root/` | The root user's home folder |

##### Safety tips
- **Read the command before pressing Enter**, especially anything with `rm`.
- Before editing a settings file, **copy it**: `sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak`
- If a command asks `[Y/n]`, read what it's about to remove before answering.
- Recovery depends on the operation. Record values/backups before changes; deletion and credential changes may have no simple undo.

##### Practice a safe inspect–edit–verify–undo cycle

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS — Practice a safe inspect–edit–verify–undo cycle**

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🎯 What:** Learn quoting, exit status, file editing and recovery on a harmless private practice file.

> [!NOTE]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **💡 Why it matters:** Commands act on exact paths; spaces, shell wildcards and redirection change their meaning. A blank result is not proof of success.

> [!CAUTION]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **🛑 Before changing anything:** Use a normal user's terminal on a permitted practice image. These commands do not need sudo. Do not use a real security configuration for your first editing exercise.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — GUI (when available):** Open **Terminal** from the desktop menu. Open the file manager alongside it and compare your home directory with `pwd` and `ls -la`. In a terminal, **Ctrl+Shift+V** pastes; inspect the whole pasted line before Enter.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> pwd
> mkdir -m 700 "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice"
> ```
>
If the directory exists, inspect it instead of overwriting existing work. Create a harmless file:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'original value' > "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt"
```

Double quotes keep the path with spaces together; `$HOME` expands to your home folder. Single quotes keep text literal. `>` overwrites a file; `>>` appends. Neither belongs in a command unless you intend a write.

> [!NOTE]
> **🔁 ALTERNATE METHOD — Terminal commands.** Use when the GUI is unavailable or a precise setting requires it. The GUI and CLI are **not two separate tasks**.
>
>
> ```bash
> cp -p "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt" "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt.before"
> nano "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt"
> ```
>
Change the text, **Ctrl+O → Enter** to save, **Ctrl+X** to leave. Use `command --help` or `man command` to inspect options; press `q` to leave a manual. A leading `#` in handbook prose is not a command prompt to paste.

**✅ Check it worked:**

```bash
cat "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt"
echo "$?"
```

`$?` is the previous command's exit status: usually 0 means success; nonzero needs interpretation. For `grep`, 1 means no match, while 2 commonly means an error. Check immediately; any intervening command changes `$?`. `&&` runs the next command only after success, but a beginner should inspect commands individually first.

> [!WARNING]
> **ℹ️ EXTRA INFO — explanation, safety or rollback; not a separate required task**
> **↩️ Undo:**

```bash
cp -p "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt.before" "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt"
cat "$HOME/cp-terminal-practice/example notes.txt"
```

Expect `original value`. Practice files may be removed through the file manager after you have checked their paths.

> **⚠️ Warnings:** `sudo command > /protected/file` elevates the command, not the shell opening the file. Do not solve permission errors with `chmod 777`. Avoid `rm -rf`, guessed wildcards, copied shell prompts and piping downloads into a shell. **Ctrl+C** is appropriate for a stuck search, but interrupting package configuration or file writes can leave incomplete work.

## Part 6 — Final Verification

> [!TIP]
> ✅ **Finish strong:** Verify the final configuration, required functionality, and saved evidence.


Verify every required service, account, journal/forensic answer, firewall path and score before finishing.

### 19. Final checklist

- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Answered and **saved** every forensics question before deleting/modifying evidence.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Recorded all README-authorized normal users, admin users and necessary system/service accounts.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Preserved a working administrator/root recovery session and tested a second authorized login.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Verified password aging, empty passwords, relevant PAM profiles and sudo membership.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Checked installed APT sources match Debian **codename** and have valid signature verification.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Reviewed and applied approved available security updates; inspected held packages and `dpkg --audit`.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Confirmed one appropriate firewall manager and only README-required inbound access.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Confirmed SSH, DNS, web, database, Samba, FTP, DHCP, mail and other **required** services function from authorized clients.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Checked known unwanted daemons, unauthorized packages and unwanted media/files without mass deletion.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Reviewed cron, systemd timers, startup entries, accounts, SUID/capabilities, suspicious ports and file hashes.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Checked AppArmor, journald/rsyslog/auditd, and desktop lock/autologin for this actual Debian image.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Refreshed the Scoring Report and recorded each changed item and verification result.
- [ ] **🎯 DO THIS —** Saved changes and forensic answers, but **do not reboot** before the rules and outstanding updates permit it.

**⭐ EASIEST WAY — Terminal command(s):**

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
id
sudo visudo -c
sudo dpkg --audit
apt list --upgradable 2>/dev/null
systemctl --failed
sudo ss -lntup
sudo journalctl -p err -n 30 --no-pager
```

**If something breaks:** Look at the last change, exact unit status, kernel/application logs, network listener, authorization and file backup. Restore the **smallest changed setting**, retest the README-required service, then refresh the score. Never reset the whole firewall, wipe logs, remove all media or purge unrelated packages to solve one failure.

**Content scope:** This is a consolidated reference and not a statement that every change earns a point. Where inherited historical instructions conflict with the current Debian package/version or a competition image's README, **inspect the installed implementation and prioritize the README**. The guide intentionally includes overlapping manual procedures so it remains independently usable.
